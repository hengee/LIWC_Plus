<laughter> um moscow um my family moved to the u_s and then i moved down here eventually for college  uh it took a long time to i've been living here for about a year since i graduated so there's been a lot of ups and downs but finally gotten adjusted to it so it took a while though it goes off and on i have two roommates and there's always a little bit of drama here and there between the girls but for the most part after a year and a couple months i think we finally learned how to live together but it was pretty much like a reality t_v show for a while one's from college and the other one we found on craigslist it varies depending on whether or not we're mad at each other so um i guess pretty close right now we're kinda distant oh about the distant okay um well we  haven't seen each other we haven't hung out in like two weeks 'cause one of them got into like this car accident and um so she's been distant since then and kinda locks herself up in her room and the other one is always working late so we just our our scheduling has been off and no one's really made an attempt to hang out with anyone so it's kind of we're just waiting for someone i guess to make the first move  it's okay it'll get better it depends with whom  i'm dealing with i guess i would say with some people i guess with my family not very good my boyfriend it's not very good but with other people that i might not know so well then i'm able to control it a little bit more but it'll be more passive aggressive than like full on anger oh 'cause i don't want them to see me as a bitch [laughter] yeah uh probably my best friend nicole she's probably been we've been best friends for like god since high school freshman year of high school is when we first met so long time so yeah um of of what  uh my friend nicole um we met in french class freshman year of high school we were in the same class and then we kinda started doing homework together and we had a lot of class the same classes together and so we just kinda started hanging out and then we just became closer and have stayed really close since then mhm um uh going out with friends going to bars going dancing biking hiking staying active um going to the movies going out to eat at restaurants uh photography um just hanging out with friends i guess whatever uh it varies like i'm really close to them when it comes to things about like school work um those kinds of things but when it comes to relationships and friendships and more personal personal things  i don't really discuss that with them so i guess superficially close but i rely on them a lot so we're close i guess mhm uh that's a good question um i guess it depends who it is again i guess people who are inconsiderate unthoughtful flakey ignorant and uh conceited [cons] uh yeah i guess those kinds of people and when people just um what makes me mad that's a good question i guess a lot of things make me mad [laughter] but it's mostly how people react to um different situations can make me angry i guess uh yesterday and it was my boyfriend and we argued because he's trying to be healthy and workout and save money  and so and so by doing that what he does is he orders pizza in so he's not saving money and he's not being healthy and so i got frustrated with him 'cause i'm constantly trying to push him to be healthy and each time he's like i'm gonna do it i'm gonna do it so he's constantly breaking promises that's another thing that makes me angry is people that don't follow through about other people or about myself or angry xxxx [laughter] um angry i guess i'll go with that no i don't feel angry often dang it that is a tough one how 'bout just getting paid to be me um i don't know that what i'm kind of trying to figure out right now 'cause i quit my full time job 'cause i hated it it was just mostly sitting in an office all day which i thought was extremely boring so now i work in a restaurant job and i'm trying to look for a second job to support myself um  my dream job i don't know what it would be but i know it would involve people and i'd love to have some kind of like finished product or some kind of accomplishment towards the end i guess it's something that i realized i like to see the result from all my hard work 'cause i majored in sociology and as much as i loved that major is you realize it's a whole lot of theorizing and arguing but with no real solution so it's just like at the end all you have is just these theoretical elements that you can't really do anything with and nothing to show for your work except for a piece of paper with your essays or notes so something to do with people and maybe something artistic i love photography i love cooking baking in particularly so i don't know something in that realm i guess i used to travel a lot my family is known for traveling we've gone to gosh seven eight different countries i've lived in three or four different countries i haven't traveled a lot lately just because i have no money and jobs kinda tie you down but i would love to have that i guess my dream job would be a photographer that for national geographic that would be awesome um or a huge photographer that travels that'd be awesome too but anyways um yeah i do travel a lot in the new places new faces new experiences i get restless very easily so it's nice to constantly be on the move and see different things and see different cultures and types of people and just not get stuck in the same routine i hate the routine and mundaneness of everyday life so it's nice to stir things up oh gosh okay um i'm trying to think one of my trips i guess we can talk about i don't know it's funny even though i've been to lots of different countries one of my most memorable memorable trips is one of the trips that i took with my family i was a three week roadtrip with my family there's five of us packed in a tiny little station wagon i know needless to say it's like when you're that close proximity for three weeks camping you start getting on each others' nerves but it was really fun and like even though i've traveled so many places i realized that there's like such a beauty in the american landscape and so we were all around the southwest and the grand canyon to zion to the grand tetons to yellowstone and it was absolutely amazing just seeing all that natural beauty so um and we saw a grizzly bear black bear lots of bison a wolf and it was really cool those kinds of i don't know natural wonders also really amaze me 'cause those things aren't man made and as as pretentious as it sounds after a while europe kinda gets not old but it's like you know you get the same idea like white old white men building great buildings and art work and it's beautiful and all but like you just kind of like okay i wanna see something that's natural and beautiful or something that's different too cool um pretty easy as long as I get well no i always sleep so easy oh grumpy and just very lethargic and just low energy don't say much and just kinda off in my own world i not not anymore i usually get enough sleep and i've been working out more so it's kind of  energizing me so no it's not too bad that's good uh i guess i've just been more negative but it has to do with like circumstances kind of like uh it's been about five months since i quit my full time job haven't found anything else haven't really found anything else i'm interested in so it's more of just like ugh what am i doing da da da that kind of thing yeah it's it is hard the market and just like i'm very picky 'cause i don't wanna just sittin in a little my own cubicle 'cause i quit my job exactly for that reason so why go back to another job just do the same exact thing that i quit my other job for so it's just like i have to make it worthwhile that i quit my last job to get a better job so it's just kinda like i'm stuck in this section of just like living paycheck to paycheck barely making it and just waiting for the right opportunity to come across but it's like when do i give up and sell my soul and go back to the corporate world of sitting in little cubicles i don't know yeah it is hard but i mean i guess everyone goes through that same situation after college so but i guess it's tough 'cause a lot of my friends 'cause i went to a pretty good school and you know i have a friend who's teaching english in afghanistan and i have another one who's met the president you know and one that's doing teach for america another friend who's in harvard uh school for like harvard masters [mass] you know getting her masters so it's kind of like ahh all that comparison and then here i am working a little restaurant job so uh i do sometimes yes but i'm going to hawaii next week so right now i'm fine [laughter] yes but yeah usually it's been kind of like down because i'm just trying to find like what i'm supposed to like you know what do i want to do next and like money situations which is very stressful especially when you have school loans to pay off insurance rent car loans like it's just groceries like i can't even afford groceries so it's just hard to like live this way especially after you've paid so much money for like an amazing college education so it's a little bit frustrating but there's a lot of people in the same situation it's all good uh no i don't think so but i mean i think everyone goes through depression here and there so i don't know if you can but not like medically diagnose i'm not on meds nope nope oh let's see uh to try lots of different things and not be afraid to fail 'cause i'm one of those people if i'm not gonna be the best at something then i'm just not gonna try i accept the best or nothing at all go big or go home so but i think i would've told my high school self that go and try lots of things even if it means i'm not gonna be the best at it so ten years ago well that would've made me like twelve so  [laughter] um i used to do a lot of things i i used to act i think i would've continued doing that i used to write a lot when i was younger i used to write miniature like little stories  short stories for my parents all the time and i kind of stopped doing those things 'cause it's like oh i'm not good at it so i'm not gonna do it and i think if i just continued doing those things and tried you know different classes  um i don't know different sports i kinda just stuck with soccer growing up i don't know just expand myself more rather than like find something i'm good at and just stay with it but never really try harder kinda just like stay i always kinda stayed at one level but once i'm good i just stay for good i don't try to go above that if that makes any sense uh right now it's super lame but i watch t_v [laughter] but i used to read a i used to read on my off time or just listen to music or just take a nap or bake but now it's just like since i'm on my feet all day and like constantly interacting with people i just kinda wanna unwind by like sitting and lying on the couch and being like i'm done so [laughter] that's a tough question um probably the day i got accepted into pomona college um i was a freshman at wellesley college which is the women's college back east and i hated it from like the second from like the first week i just knew that i chose the wrong college and i was like miserable for the entire year and i only only applied to one school to transfer pomona college like that's out in claremont and um i didn't think i was gonna get in and i was 'cause it was like a four percent acceptance rate and i was like what are the chances like this is ridiculous i don't think i'm gonna get in and i was like you know the thought of going back to wellesley was super depressing  um but then i got an email from one of the admission counselors that i had met when i was visiting pomona and he was like hi tatiana like um just wanted to see if you had any last minute questions about pomona hope all is well and i was like why would he be emailing me the day we find out if we got you know accepted or not um unless i got the acceptance and so sure enough a couple hours later i got the email that i was accepted into pomona and i was ecstatic that was like that best day of my life i was so happy that's probably one yeah it was awesome then i took my mom and my little brother out to dinner and i went and bought myself some new dresses went and just like went crazy dyed my hair pierced my nose i was like let's start this whole thing over so [laughter] yeah bubbly  fun  maybe moody you never know what you're gonna get sometimes um probably   uh definitely friendly um and pretty like a positive person um but sometimes maybe a little bit aggressive but for the most part i think positive things i mean she's my best friend so [laughter] huh  really happy oh when i was in mexico over winter well no i don't know my boyfriend took me on a sailing trip down in  san clemente and that was really fun and we just like went sailing and walked around the missions hung out on the beach that was really fun that was a good time yeah it was cool [laughter] bye 
yes  okay  connecticut um  to be an actor <laughter>  well i moved to san francisco in ninety four and then i moved to atlanta in ninety six and then i moved out here to be an actor and i became a realtor instead  um to be on a t_v show an actor  it's pretty hard to get discovered and uh  you have to be lucky and you have to know the right people and you have to be talented   <laughter> yeah  not really no i don't travel that much i used to move um every couple years to a different city and then i've been here for a while so i don't travel much the weather um there's always something to do and um that's pretty much it <laughter>  um the people here tend to be a little more rude and um it's just always a fast pace  well when i moved here i was twenty five so it was a lot more fun because when you're young in the city you can have a lot of fun    and then i got into the real estate and did really well for a while and then the market crashed and so now i'm old and i'm not making any money so times are tough  no no i'm much <mu> much of more <m> more of an extrovert  um when i don't get what i want <laughter> and um  rude people  and um  just inconsiderate people  i'm pretty good um at controlling my temper when i'm not uh like if i if i drink alcohol it'll make my temper go worse but uh <ss noise> when i don't drink i'm pretty good at controlling my temper   uh the last time i argued with somebody was  somebody that owed me money  uh i live uh in west hollywood  no no no i live alone i have a dog it's good i mean i don't like my neighbors i hate my neighbors but the ones upstairs just moved out so that's good news hopefully the ones that move in are not that noisy and the ones below i just can't stand because they argue with me   huh why because they 'cause my hardwood floors they say that eh i've been there for ten years and they still argue about the noise of me walking on my hardwood floors  yeah  what was the question  my mother has been a very positive influence she's always kept me on track she lived with me for the last ten years until she recently moved to rhode island to live with my brother very close to my mother um not so close with my brother mm we're close but we're not like close close um so i mean we love each other we just don't really understand each other all the time  outgoing um life of the party  ambitious um  and sometimes cut-throat  um <psh psh> what am i most proud of  being always able to get through the things i need to get through to get to where i wanna be i'm generous i'm loyal uh i'm friendly i'm accommodating and um  that's about it  no yes  uh about four years ago  um i well i had <ha> i was beaten up and i had uh identity theft and uh you know i was just afraid to go out so i needed to get over that so after spending one year in in my home without leaving um and just depressed all the time i i said i have to get out and start talking to people and so i did    thank you  um okay i'm panicky about the job situation  um you know 'cause my bills are pretty high and i don't really have a steady income right now  so uh that's what's worrying me the most is my uh financial situation  yeah  um  yeah i mean  well basically it's like um i just recently quit drinking all together so i don't drink anymore so i'm noticing  yeah i mean it's good 'cause of number one i don't have the money and number two i don't like the way i act when i drink   um so so that's a positive thing but well the when i was drinking it helped me just forget and numb myself now i have to feel through the feelings which is pretty good 'cause i can talk my way through them so i guess i'm evolving  uh yeah a long time ago um you know i've taken many medications here and there and um they really some of 'em would numb me some of them would  make me feel hyper so i've recently decided to <t> in the last six months three to six months just to not take anything so i don't take anything i barely even take an aspirin  just to get my body to a to get my body to a normal state   um not really  always worrying just a lot of worrying always worrying worrying worrying about everything oh what happens if i get in car accident what happens if i can't pay my mortgage what happens if i eh eh just so many things i worry about and that's what was making me depressed i do at some point i've had some good therapists and i've had some bad therapists  um i tend to like the ones that talk back to me and kinda give me some guidance as opposed to the ones that just listen   and then they just say okay your time's up so and just prescribe me medication so i think i'd be better with a psychiatrist <psychia> psychologist as opposed to a psychiatrist um well i'm not going to therapy now but  the therapy that i had before um  was more like people trying to uh just come in and check in and give me medication um i have had other therapy where i was back and forth like okay well this is what i think about this and you think about this and that kind of therapy is better  um i just i wasn't getting the right therapists recently so um and i knew the the root of my problem was the drinking 'cause it's a depressant so  mm you know stopping the drinking is definitely made me have a much clearer mind and just to work through things myself you know  um  i can't really think of anything right now  um  it's been a long time i can't really think about a time when i felt really happy  thank you <sniffle> um  okay when i was a kid um  i had a a little dog and this big dog came and and attacked it and killed it  so then a little while later my father  came and he says to my brother and me we were kids go to the car there's two packages in the car so go get them  so i was like yeah yeah yeah yeah 'cause i never listened to my parents so i was just like a spoiled brat but finally he said go to the car what's that   oh okay he said go to the car and get this out of the car so i finally went and when i opened the door there was a new dog and a bag of dog food so that's one of my memorable esperiences   yeah 'cause i'm an animal lover so  um just the way that i've treated people before when i was hurting i was really mean or rude to people when i felt like you know i was hurting i had to hurt everybody around me so um but when <wh> ever since i stopped the drinking i don't do that anymore so  so i think the problem is is the drinking and so now that i've let that go uh 'cause i was doing it for the wrong reasons you know i was doing it to not not feel i wasn't doing it to be sociable  get in a career that is really stable  like uh eh you know like a a doctor or a nurse or an attorney something that you know or in advertising i should've gone into that a sales position is it could be very well and very good or very bad so you always have to be on it in sales you can make a ton of money in sales but when you make your money save your money don't go spend it on extravagant things  um when i have a job when i when i'm able to work  uh when i'm helping other people  uh when other people around me are happy and laughing when i can make people laugh that that puts me in a good mood  okay thank you  you're welcome thank you  bye  
yes i'm okay  uh i'm from here originally los angeles  mhm um i like the weather  and my family's here which is why i'm here i moved away for a while uh i like that there's a lot of culture <cult> even though everyone says there's not culture in l_a there is a lot of culture there's theater and film and lots of museums and things like that all different kinds of people i like the diversity    mhm um  well i don't like that i had to move back kind of against my will <laughter> so starting a new career uh starting over in my career it so that's not really something uh well i moved back 'cause my dad was sick  so thank you  thank you so that's why i'm here but it also means i live with my dad and my brother who are like hoarders and ridiculous so  uh acting theater it was mhm yeah  yeah i am   i'm an actor i uh right now i'm doing a a theater show and auditioning and taking some classes and  that sort of thing  um well my parents are both artsy people and i grew up around it and for a long time i was singing and then uh i was went to study musical theater and somewhere along the lines i realized that acting was more my bag than singing i suppose but i still do both  mhm no i don't  uh i don't usually have trouble talking to people uh i'm pretty friendly i can get along with most people people usually tell me their secrets within five minutes of meeting me which i feel is a mark of an extrovert <laughter>    <laughter> um  i take a bath or read a book uh go out with my friends go to the theater uh eh sometimes my work is very relaxing so sometimes just like singing a song or any of that going for a walk  mhm yoga things that make me mad um  injustice <laughter> i can be very righteously indignant i suppose um  people who don't see those things and people who've who have a like entitlement i think entitlement and sense of privilege that can make me mad  yeah  uh  it depends i usually <usual> a lot of times it's i argue my case <laughter> i guess <laughter> um or i i call my best friend usually and complain talk to her about it  pretty good pretty good i don't have too much of a temper  um like a real argument or like a debate  <laughter> um if was a real argument it probably would be my ex-boyfriend and we just argued about why we broke up stupid things like that  eh i think i was kind of over it by then but  it was at times  <laughter>  um  the last time i felt really happy  was like really happy probably hanging out hanging out with friends the other night i had a good time uh scrubbed_entry it is it's nice it's nice my best friend would describe me as an open book she often makes fun of me for like just telling everyone everything um she would describe me as   uh compassionate and uh having a a strong sense of who i am  i think yeah she also she would describe me as not having like a good sense of social norms sometimes probably that's something that she  makes fun of me for um because i do just like tell everyone everything and don't realize that i have like holes in my clothes and things like that but nothing nothing bad we have a very good relationship hmm yeah yeah it has <laughter> not terrible trouble but but yeah it's gotten me in trouble before sure  no i haven't  no but i think i had it  but i never went to a doctor  um 'cause i had a i had a traumatic situation uh where somebody injured me and i i feel <fe> when i looked up p_t_s_d later i realized <reali> i felt like i had all of the symptoms of like going back into situations like that i would get panicky and um it was very     uh i held on to it for a really really long time i think um i think that i did have it but i just i don't know 'cause i never i never saw anyone about it   um  sometimes yeah uh certain physical things with that part of my body can be a trigger or um it happened in a in an acting class so sometimes certain teachers if they criticize in a certain way i start to i start to panic even if they're totally right and i know they're right and like it's something that someone else could tell me and i'd be fine with it eh sometimes it'll make me a little upset or panicky yeah  no well i mean my dad is sick so not great  but um but considering not terrible  um i've been having bad dreams  uh  uh just like stress dreams i think having to do with my dad   um  like getting kidnapped or my teeth falling out things that if you looked them up always say like there's something out of your control which is like exactly what it is so      it's not the best but it's just dreams at least so   which way  okay  easy very easy  i am tired and maybe somewhat irritable goofy i get really goofy yeah  um i am fairly non-judgmental  of other people i i i stay open-minded uh i can make most people laugh i'm funny uh creative  um i yeah those are some of the best ones i'd say   yeah  i love meeting new people and seeing new things and learning uh and just getting out of the routine i like staying in hotels uh i like most things about traveling i even i even like flying i like all of it well i just finished a tour a couple months ago um going up and down the east coast and then across the u_s and uh performing for kids all over   yeah and then we ended here in l_a  yeah yeah it was great it was a good time  yeah um  lemmi think we  we went to  the hot springs the naturally occuring hot springs in colorado and that was really nice that was a nice way to unwind yeah  a lot of people i i would say um i mean my dad comes to mind certainly uh my godmother is a huge positive influence in my life as well   uh my best friend my best friend from high school i think i uh some <so> a few of my best friends from high school um and college that i've kinda grown up with and become who i am with them yeah  mhm uh small things sure  yeah uh i regret  the way that i dealt with a friendship that was ending once uh i regret  committing to certain people that i've dated  uh  but nothing huge i i tend to go well i won't do that again but i don't spend a lot of time like being upset about things i've done in the past  hmm stand up for yourself  um  <laughter> don't date felons <laughter> uh i think that i i don't have any trouble standing up for things that i believe in but sometimes i have trouble standing up for myself i think i i really internalize the idea of like you know women being too needy or uh or um i don't know those kinds of things and then xxx and so as as an adolescent and growing up i felt like well you then you just shouldn't need anything or you're needy and it took me a while to be able to like voice what i want what i needed from other people and be okay with that and it's still something i work on  <laughter> i'm glad you think so  um  <sigh> that's a good question uh  my friends and family  and uh  i my talents i would say  yeah  yeah my ability to take situations and  take bad situations and continue and uh make the best of everything  alright  <laughter> thank you  goodbye goodbye <laughter>  
yes  i'm okay  here in los angeles  there's a lot of things to do i love the beach  um i love the i love that it's sunny all the time  um the amount of people  um  that's really about it the amount of people  just a little  i just like um going to new places and just discovering new things  um i recently went to new york i was there for about three months  um and it was extremely boring i went to western new york  um and it was extremely uh snowy and um  i didn't <didn> was in a position where i didn't have a car so i didn't get to go very many places and i was in a small town   so um  i uh  uh it was beautiful for what i got to see but really  it wasn't really much to it <laughter>  yeah  um  both i'm both an introvert and an extrovert  um  i really enjoy doing things by myself  um  i um have a lot of my own um my likes and dislikes and i've spent a lot of time alone even though um i have <ha> i do have a lot of friends and uh when i do go out i i do tend to meet a lot of people but um i also enjoy um being by myself a lot  um  probably outgoing creative um  talented  um fun trustworthy  um  i studied language um  and um physics  and um  math no i'm not  i'm actually um i'm um i'm trying to be an actress  it was something that i fell into when i was a teenager  scrubbed_entry and uh i really enjoyed doing it and i hadn't done it for years um  so i figured why not i just came back to california and might as well try something that i did enjoy really doing   um so far um i just got picked up by an agent  so i haven't really done anything yet as an adult  but um  i'm hoping  hoping something it'll be fruitful   um  <sigh> i really don't haven't had too many  um  i guess my sister she's done really well  um  my boyfriend he's a  he's a very positive human being  um  but um  really i haven't had too many positive influences  um  i'm close i mean we <w> we hang out um i i don't tell them everything  um they're kind of judgmental  but um  other than that i mean i mean we hang out i mean i see them every day  um  geez um  it's kinda hard for me to relax um i mean i try to watch t_v um and i read  a lot um  that's probably about it i read i do a lot of sleeping <laughter> i'm a little depressed so um  yeah it's kinda it's xxx like i said it's really hard for me to relax  um  it isn't  um i tend to think a lot  um about the things that stress me out  um i've been through a lot of a lot of stuff so um  yeah so i i don't i don't i don't sleep very well at night and if i do fall asleep i wake up all through the night usually with some kind of anxiety attacks  um  i dream a lot about um the stuff that has uh  has affected me throughout the years so um  it's usually you know like i i'll dream about something that stressed me out and then i'll wake up and my my chest'll hurt    um  or just i just can't sleep all night because i just think i seem to be i don't know if i'm afraid to go to sleep  but i uh <sigh> i just i don't know i feel like that <th> that's a vulnerable place for me  because of stuff that've happened to me  so um  i i so i sleeping is just not really something i do well  um  tired  i'm uh  i'm moody i'm very sensitive  um  i uh i'm just negative <ne> a negative person  um which really that's not me um  i uh yeah i'm like <l> judgmental is not me either um i just  i'm just not a not a nice person to be around  um  i try to <t> i i spend a lot of my time reading i try to go out and do um i force myself to go out and do things um  just to keep myself involved  um so that i don't uh sit <si> just sit around and and and dwell on the fact that i can't sleep and i i try to um get myself as exhausted as i possibly can  um by running around and and and doing things  so  um it's difficult  um i do like there is a part of me that doesn't wanna  i don't really wanna go out and do things i have to actually force myself to um if i have make appointments i uh  i make appointments to like for auditions or or um  even to do this i um i i tend to uh  just not  like at the last minute i'll i'll try to convince myself not to go <laughter> but then i force myself to anyways   yes  um i've been diagnosed for two instances  um i was diagnosed <dia> diagnosed about three years three and a half years ago  and then i was diagnosed again um in august um  the first time it was um  i just wasn't sleeping <sl> because of the not sleeping um   and the uh just the stress <st> the unbelievable stress  um  and then the second time it was a xxx uh once again i started with the not sleeping um and then every moment of the day was just thinking about what happened to me um  and i just i i just couldn't take it anymore  so i i figured um  i was getting too gloomy i was getting like um  not thinking life was worth it and and i i i that's i just needed to see somebody before anything escalated  yeah  it was  i no <n> do not um one of the reasons i went to new york was to try to um  get out of my environment  um and uh  and that seemed to help a lot  um  and uh out here i i was i just the counselors that i was going to just didn't really seem to be helping me much  um they just  they just seemed to be giving me a lot of medications and i don't believe that that's what i needed  um  yeah so um  yeah  <sigh> stressed um uh lately i've been really sad and i don't know why   um  but like i said i've been trying to combat that by um   keeping myself busy  um  actually um  i'm kind of a couple days ago  i was actually really happy and i was genuinely happy   um but then i went back to  being you know going back to feeling miserable  so um  well i realized  i got up in the morning i actually did get a good night of sleep  and um  i realized uh that i'm actually really lucky  um 'cause i've been through a lot in my life and i have um somebody in my life who really loves me and somebody who um is finally there for me  and uh  you know he gives me what i need emotionally and i was just really thankful for that  and that made me really happy  um  yeah  thank you <laughter> oh geez um  i've had so many years of just  just bad just a lot of bad  that it there has it's been a long time  since i've been proud of anything  i guess if anything it's my ability to survive through all the hardships i've been through  um my <m> a lesser person i guess would've  gotten rid of themselves a long time ago  but um even though like i'm really depressed and i feel gloomy and i feel <fe> just feel miserable about a lot of things um  there's gotta be a silver lining  so  um so yeah so i mean like i guess that's what i'm proud of that uh  i although a whole bunch of bad things have happened to me it hasn't ruined me i still try to be a good person um i i try not to be negative towards other people  and um  and truthful and i still i still have drive in me  yeah  ugh <sigh> so much um  my last marriage um not getting out when i should have  um  and uh just i regret a lot <sigh> um the any situation that would've had a red flag um  eh just get out of it you know eh some things just don't work and um  no matter how hard you try no matter how much you put into it so um  i i would tell myself um to um  that it's not selfish  to let go of a bad situation  and um not everybody can be helped so sometimes you just gotta live for yourself and help yourself  so if had i known that then had had i known that then i i i probably would've done better in life so  yeah  <sigh> um people who um  when people are down on me for my faults  um that i have done that i have things that i've done in my past that people steal still relive when i'm trying to forgive myself um  people who are mean to other people uh people who talk poorly about people behind their backs people that are untrustworthy um just anybody who picks on the little guy  um  you know people who don't care about the environment or animals um  i just <jus> i think that everybody should be as good as they possibly can be  and uh it's it's disheartening and it it just makes me so mad that people just can't be people don't let people live people try to make um everybody feel as negative and as poorly as they do  and uh i that makes me mad  <laughter> i vent <laughter> um  yeah i tend to vent and then uh  and them um and then it's usually over i try not to bad mouth people um i try to just talk through it until um until it's gone and then it doesn't bother me anymore mm i try not to get angry um  because i have a really bad temper and it um  and it can get outta hand so um  what i do is i i <laughter> something gets me so mad i tend to go and take a nap  um <laughter> if i'm not in that situation where i can just go and take a nap um i usually just walk away from the situation and i try to clear my mind and come back to it  um  it was a couple days ago it was actually with my mother um  it was about um  actually she thought that i had taken a shirt from her  and um she was screaming and yelling at me and um  i was i was tired um i was it was late and um  i started to yell at <a> back at her you know because i was hurt that she would accuse me of something so petty um  and you <yo> <sigh> it's uh going back to my past you know when i was younger and you know i didn't care about you know people's things and i would just kinda take and do whatever i wanted to and i'm not i'm so far from that person   um and i it it hurt me so i got mad and i and i started to yell and argue  mm kinda petty and stupid but  at the time it it seemed  it seemed uh  viable  um  hmm one of my most memorable experiences  um  god <go> i've had so many um  maybe it was um  i don't know um  it was  probably um  graduating pharmacy school  um i felt pretty great i didn't know if i was doing  uh very very well or not um and i ended up getting like on my last test scores i getting <get> ended up getting like ninety eight percent  and um  i uh  i actually i didn't <did> i had no confidence <laughter> that i had done well in class in school at all and i i didn't even know how i was getting the grades i was getting um so that was a really big accomplishment for me um  and uh yeah that was a great it was a great memory yeah  yeah  um  i'm reliable  um  i um  i'm talented  um i i'm a good listener um  i'm always there to help people  um  i tend to always try to do the right thing  um  sometimes actually i forget that i have any good qualities but  um  and just  i uh  all around i try to be you know as as good and the best person that i can be to other people and myself um  yeah  um  going to comedy shows  um  just um  having moments where you just laugh with people  um  sometimes just reading puts me in a good mood uh  i don't know probably that's about it  uh huh  okay  thank you  bye 
<sync> yes i'm okay um i'm a little pensive i guess a little uh down but more or less okay i was born in annapolis maryland on the east coast originally i moved because i went to film school um and but then i decided to come i moved to washington d_c to do some work and now i'm back here again it's very different um being from the east coast it just has a different feel to it um but living l_a is very has a very different kind of um attitude i guess and so it's a little difficult but i but i've gotten more used to it since i've been here uh not at all um when i left things got things were sort of i i lost my job out there and so i had to move out here kind of quick to um to be with uh some people who were gonna help me out and i'm just sort of i don't know if estranged is the right word but i'm just kind of not really speaking to my family or old friends that often it's not easy it's it's kind of um i miss i miss a lot of people i miss my old life before i lost my job um i miss um some friends um i miss a lot of the relationships that i had out there um so it's difficult i mean it weighs on my mind a lot um i feel like i failed and now i'm here and i can't seem to get back on my feet so it's it's it's hard depends on the situation i think i'm outgoing when i'm comfortable um and then i'm extremely outgoing but when i'm in a situation i'm not comfortable with i tend to be a lot more shy so that doesn't really answer your question but um [clears throat] i have certain i do i do a lot of writing um i have certain music that i listen to as i'm writing and when i can when i can get really into that and sort of shut out the rest of the world um the music and the the thoughts just kind of happening really um it can it soothes me it's like it's when i feel most relaxed i guess um a few weeks ago i guess i was i'd been working on a book on a on a on a novel and when i was really when i was really getting into writing it and um it was really working for me that was that was good that was really good i felt like i was accomplishing something and i felt really relaxed um it was about a guy who is searching for something it's it's uh it's his last day on earth and so he's going to find a person that he that he met and just was so struck by that he needs to he needs to find her and spend the last few minutes that he has on earth with her just because sort of uh it's sort of romantic adventure comedy kind of thing well i've always i've always been a writer part of the reason i came to l_a was because of screenwriting um so i wrote some screenplays and uh you know had a little success with that out here and but since since then i've kind of gotten tired of the limitations of the screenwriting and i've started to write more short stories and and longer just creative writing so i i've been meaning to write a novel but i was just waiting for the idea to to really hit me it's not easy the [exhale] the parts the parts when it's good it's really good but getting there is sometimes a real struggle um i find it difficult i have a real love hate relationship with writing when i when i love it i just absolutely love it but sometimes i hate it because it's so difficult um but it's worth it for the times when it's when it's good good i don't i don't really have a temper i it's not i mean most of my anger that i have is directed inward as opposed to outward to other people um if something is really really stressful or if i'm in a situation like a very intense confrontation i can lose it but i probably <prob> that's probably only happened to me three four times in my whole life i mean generally i pretty much try to it when i'm upset i i get upset with myself not with other people um last night i guess well <weh> um i got in an argument about whether or not cleaning vegetables was necessary because of i forget it but it well no it was about whether you can clean vegetables after you cut them because i'd already started cutting the vegetables and i thought that would be okay so it turned into this big argument and we did google searches to figure out who was right and who was wrong and i i ended up being wrong on that one but it is yeah that was it wasn't a blow up argument but it was a definite argument um uh a lot so much um uh i i i was in uh a relationship that i really really um that i really wanted to work and uh i ended up and it was partly due to i hadn't i was on i wasn't on the right medication and so i was going at like everything sort of spiraled out of control and i feel really guilty about the way that that ended and i mean i wasn't i wasn't mean but i was but i was getting more and more messed up and i couldn't stop it and it ended and so i feel really guilty about not doing enough and and not and and you know making her have to tell me that she never wanted to see me again so that was pretty that was pretty tough well some of it was was that i wasn't medicated properly i mean now i've been to a doctor and i'm on medication that's completely kind of i mean i still get i still get upset and i still get depressed but it's not like it was it's not i don't completely lose it for days at a time um so i mean i know there's a part of me that knows logically that it wasn't all my fault and that if i had if i had been able to deal with the chemicals in my brain then i would've then it would've probably be different if i was who i am now then i would've i would i would be i would be it probably would have gone very differently or maybe it wouldn't have but i mean i could have i don't know i don't know if i could've done anything different things being how they were i mean it's it's possible uh i mean obviously yeah because i mean that's what i do i i take little things <thin> i mean i take little things and i just think about them all the time in my head until until it drives me crazy i dwell on stuff um and it's like any little detail that comes up i suddenly remember and it can just throw me off for a whole day i mean i still i still get i still get really uncomfortable and embarassed and then feel ashamed about stuff that i did in high school which was years and years ago which i shouldn't even be thinking about anymore 'cause it's so in the past but i still get that feeling like i'm right back there well it's it's not easy i've been trying to figure out ways to deal with it i i mean i dealt with it for a long time by by by drinking and and you know just trying to like slow my mind down that way um but you know since the medication it's been better it hasn't been impossible to deal with it hasn't been easy but it's but it's been better um well like i said i do a lot of you know if i'm if i'm writing or if i'm doing anything like i kind of have to almost be doing two things at once to occupy my brain completely um if i'm watching t_v i have to be playing a game on my phone if i'm using i'm the computer i have to be you know watching a t_v show or a movie on you know on in another window so that i can just keep my mind occupied during all of that um i just need i mean i i wish that i could just sort of let the thoughts come and deal with them but i just i can't yet they're triggered by everything pretty much anything that i that i see if i if i if i hear somebody with a dutch last name if i if i hear somebody talk about wisconsin if i hear you know people talk about just anything you know i can reach back and connect to to this it's really it's really i don't know that's the thing i mean i don't ever get a break from it yeah um i don't know i'm a very light sleeper so i awake and asleep and awake and asleep <asl> i have no problem going back to sleep but i generally you know don't i don't know i never really needed much sleep so it's just only recently that i've really started to to like feel the effects of not getting enough sleep like i would i would usually stay up until two or three in the morning so that i could just be so exhausted that i could just conk out and wake up the next day and feel fine go to work um but now it's it's it's like if i do that i can't i still don't get enough sleep i don't conk out i still just sleep very lightly you know i get up i toss and turn all night you know and now it's just it's yeah i don't sleep too great right now um pretty i mean i don't know it's hard to it's hard to know i i usually just kind of power through it and just i'm uh i'm like how i am now just i just feel bad um i think about three three four years ago um it was when i i had been given taking stuff for anxiety for for years before that but then i finally got a psychiatrist who actually sat down and talked to me and said you've actually got this situation and we need to get you on the medication that you're on is not working you need to get on this new medication that will actually start to like even you out and heal you a little bit from all this so so yeah that was that was kind of a a turning point but unfortunately it happened after everything uh went bad so i don't know in the moment i don't know i don't really think i thought about it too much then but looking back on it i feel it really makes me angry it really makes me you know given where i am right now it makes me really angry that i'm that i had to that i i lost everything because because of chemicals in my brain because of things that i couldn't control and that you know the people that were supposed to help me weren't helping me i mean i was paying i was paying a lot of money to to go see doctors and they were doing and they you know it wasn't it was it didn't help it didn't work until until you know i managed to find somebody who did work and i just yeah so i'm i'm like thanks guys for helping but it was a little it's a little late now um there really wasn't any choice i had to i was i was a mess i was it was either i was i was self medicating it was affecting my work i mean it was everything was just at there was a point where i really realized that i mean i just had to like make this different but again it was too late because you know then my review came up a few months later and you know after after everything after being institutionalized once or twice and all this stuff you know they just decided that i was just not worth keeping around so they laid me off but it was at least that and not firing me but but but yeah but so i got help but it was but it wasn't soon enough uh not not as much as i should um i go to a couple of meetings i go to i go to a_a so that i can um you know keep control of that aspect too <t> too and there's a there's a therapy aspect to that um unfortunately you know being unemployed my unemployment ran out you know i'm i'm you know i'm getting my medication from the city of l_a so you know i'm not really in a position to put money into seeing somebody so i have a psychiatrist that i go see but it's really very i've i've only seen her three times in the past year so it's basically to keep my medication coming and then there's you <laughter> right well like i said i mean just the talk <tah> i mean the the let's just take the a_a for example because that's probably the closest <cloth> closest for that i'm seeing with therapy for now um just saying stuff outloud is just like getting getting this stuff out trying to figure out how to take that mess that's in your stomach and in your brain and make it into words and sentences that make sense that you can actually deal with is a big step like regardless of who you're saying it to whether it's a therapist or just a room full of of drunks you know i mean you're you're taking all that stuff that's that's really been killing you and you're making it into something you can deal with something that you can write down something that you can talk about as opposed to just letting it just sit there as this formless thing yeah um you know better than i than i have been um i mean it it sort of it goes <g> it has its ups and downs um you know i'm applying for jobs five six jobs or more a a day you know and never getting a response never getting an interview never even getting close to to to being self sufficient again um it's hard but that's like real world problems i feel like the chemical parts are getting under control like the the depression is getting under control so now it's just i have to deal with real life which is it just has its it's just its own own challenge yeah um it was probably you know a couple years ago um i i was i mean the thing that immediately comes to mind uh is everything was going well at my job i was making these great videos with with this person that i that iwas having a relationship with and we were really close we were having fun together and we went out and got a christmas tree and we spent the all this time picking out the perfect christmas tree and it was just feeling like a part of somebody's life and feeling like a part of the bigger the bigger life that's that's out there you know like what normal people feel you know for that instant i felt like a normal person doing a normal thing with a pretty girl who he really really liked a lot and you know everything was going really well and i mean it wasn't going really well because it was all messed up but for that instant i felt like a normal person a normal happy person and part of what makes it so hard now is knowing that i don't know if i'll ever feel that again so um probably the probably this educational <educary> educational series i did uh an educational uh video series i did for the national science foundation um it was it it was really hard and it but in the end it turned out really good and you know i'm hoping that it helps a lot of kids and it helps the world with getting kids excited about science and about um and about the world around them so that i feel like that was a real contribution that i made to the world oh it was part of you know it was part of my my job um it was it was a we were trying to come up with with new ideas uh for because we would put together videos and stuff to give you know to to schools and everything and they had done those before but we decided to do something really big you know and there was a lot of traveling and there was a lot of um and there was a lot to it and so it was probably the biggest project that the n_s_f had decided to do and so we just kind of produced it right that doesn't yeah um i guess <grunt> i don't know <laughter> uh i don't know it's been a it's been a while since i've really thought about that i don't know would i go somewhere would i i i i don't know thank you 
<synch> yeah go ahead um i'm okay i grew up in wisconsin and i lived in colorado for a bit and then i lived overseas for a little while then i moved to california mhm i moved here at the end of june of last year so i guess it's been what eight months something like that um <sigh> at the most probably twice a year <laughter> well my hometown is uh all of five thousand people  and um there are a lot of cows and barns and farms so the opposite of l_a <laughter> um <sigh> it's a good question i i've always wanted to live in california so but i had been living in in the central coast um and i just had been coming down to l_a like once a month for different business and networking and personal development stuff so um yeah things were were changing in santa cruz for me the client i had who was really the main like financial um main financial source i had that relationship ended so i was totally free to move and i thought well i guess i'll give l_a a try and see what happens so so i gave it a shot and here i am oh not at all <laughter> it's a very very big city um i lived in dublin in ireland it was a which is also a big city but you know european cities are much more condensed and the public transportation is much more easy um and yeah so just getting around here and getting familiar with the city was pretty challenging and uh yeah so <sigh> <laughter> i love to travel i love it yeah i've i i lived in ireland and i traveled um i was in morocco and i was in costa rica um i've spent some time in mexico so yeah um i love <sigh> meeting new people experiencing new cultures and like also not just seeing what's different but seeing what's similar among people everywhere you go um sure well i guess hmm i'm trying to think which was my favorite i mean eh there was amazing things about morocco and costa rica both but morocco was incredible it was like twelve days and we went to three different locations we went up in the atlas mountains which are beautiful and uh yeah it's a really really cool culture so it was fun um <sigh> my trip to ireland i actually visited there which is why i decided to move there so my most memorable moment of that trip i mean there's probably dozens but the first most memorable moment of that trip was um being on a bus and and leaving um dublin and going just out to the countryside and seeing how absolutely breathtakingly beautiful it is i mean it's everyone sees pictures of ireland or you know you see it in films and it's green and lush and gorgeous but when you actually get there and experience it it's it like the pictures don't do it justice so it was incredible yeah um i have an undergrad degree in english and psychology and a psychology minor and i have a master's degree in women studies no i use my english and psychology um i work in marketing communications so i actually do sales so um yeah the psychology definitely comes into comes into play and eh so does my i guess my undergrad degree in english but really like i took that on and and created something out of it because most people who get an english degree just teach and i i wasn't wanting to teach um to guess i'm not clear on the question um okay <laughter> wow um <sigh> you know my dream job is being a a motivational speaker and trainer and coach um and traveling the world doing that and and impacting people's lives and um really contributing to people um my relationship's pretty good actually i i just repaired my relationship with my biological mother who would not she was sporadic i saw her sporadically growing up i lived my dad raised me and then he married my stepmom and um they had two kids together so i grew up and i consider them like the family i grew up with so but i got  in communication with my biological mother um last may and we've been we've you know cleared things up and have been in communication since then so um <mutters> well not sure which moment you mean but if you're referring to being in communication with my birth mother um i mean it was very freeing to just let go of the past and let the past be the past and create something new in the future and eh not just the future but in the present moment with her so yeah i'm shy <laughter> <laughter> um to relax i do a number of things i like to do yoga although i don't have the money for it right now um i love to dance i love to read i love to go to the ocean spend time just staring at the waves and soaking up all those negative ions that really recharges my battery actually probably more than anything else um i like to be with friends um i love art and trying new restaurants um yeah all those things are both relaxing eh i guess they're relaxing in the sense that um i feel connected to the people in my life and to the experiences of my life so yeah yeah um depends if i'm driving not very good but otherwise i'm pretty good at it <laughter> um <sigh> last time i argued with somebody probably would have to be oh no it was with the l_a times about the newspaper delivery yeah that was the last time so yeah the <sigh> um the newspaper that was supposed to show up for the elderly lady that i take care of uh it didn't show up and uh i didn't realize that it wasn't there until um late i don't know afternoon i think early afternoon and then i called them and they said they couldn't send a replacement because it was after ten thirty in the morning which was absurd to me when they made the mistake in the first place so i mean for a service that you know we pay for for every day so um yeah it was i was really irratated and then i found out that the newspaper had been forwarded to a new address and that had not been communicated with me so i was angry with the l_a times i was angry with the people who'd forwarded the newspaper and didn't tell me yeah i was pretty frustrated oh wow there are quite a few of those <sigh> um let me think about one um the other day i had a phone call and i'm in a coaching program and it was from <sigh> one of the coaches in the program and she was um explaining to me that there was an additional call that was going to be we have meetings every week classroom meetings and then we also have coaching calls 'cause we have one particular coach we work with and then she called to tell me that i was going to have another coaching call with um someone who's not my coach and uh that hadn't been explained to me as part of the program so it in that moment it just seemed to me like oh my god i have all these people i have to be accountable to and i'm like eh you know i have to not just be accountable to them but share private things that are happening in my life with these people and it just was i don't know so yeah i wasn't um i wasn't angry i was just i just felt frustrated and a little overwhelmed in that moment and it you know and i talked it out with her and we got through it but um yeah i could've certainly just um been okay with whatever was being asked of me in the at that time and would've made the call go a lot smoother hmm the hardest decision wow there's been a few i guess moving to ireland was probably the hardest decision no it wasn't even the hardest decision it was such an easy decision actually but telling my family about it was challenging um that but the hardest decision was my the first time that i moved uh away from my family i was twenty eight and i decided to i chose to move to colorado and um that was a pretty tough decision 'cause at that point my family had been you know within an hour's drive of wherever i lived an hour hour and a half and now they were gonna be you know um a twelve hour drive away or a plane ride away so that was it was challenging oh lots of things um i loved colorado colorado is a beautiful beautiful state and the weather is so much better than wisconsin and um at the time i was very much into rock climbing and there's just a huge outdoor <outdoo> outdoor community in colorado so there were a lot more people who were um in my age group and or single that was another factor um and were interested in the things i was interested in so colorado just seemed like a really natural fit so yeah and then i i found a a job that i liked the pay was atrocious but um i found some work that was really rewarding and so it all came together and i chose to move yeah uh that was totally unrelated question um <sigh> relatively easily it just depends on like what time i go to sleep if i'm out and i don't get home until eleven thirty then you know then i go to bed late and uh i wake up feeling tired like i feel today but generally i can sleep through the night i've had some pretty anxiety-ridden dreams the last couple of weeks um but even so even when i wake up from those or if i you know stir from those i still can fall back to sleep relatively easily um yeah i'm sure they are i mean i'm in another transition state i'm moving out of out of the <sigh> house that i live in right now where i take care of an elderly woman <sigh> um yeah and i just i have to find the financial means to support me in doing that and it's and she creates a lot of anxiety just in her state of being she's exhausting and utterly depressing so yeah um living with her is pretty hard like it's probably the hardest thing i've ever done and i would never ever choose to do it again if i honestly if i knew what i was getting into i don't think i would've said yes to the situation um i feel trapped and helpless like there's you know nothing i can there's no way out of the situation that i'm in no matter what i do it doesn't get any better i don't <d> i don't i know i'm not getting any kind of work that i want to do and mm my money's not working at all so yeah it feels pretty crappy <laughter> thanks i have in the past yeah oh a long time i was fifteen i think or fourteen so it was over twenty years ago i was suicidal oh yeah i feel down mhm i don't actually no um well i originally stopped with my therapist because we had completed i mean we had worked on what needed to be worked on and i was no longer depressed and um and then i began therapy again later on think i was <wa> it was in my early thirties um and then i we ended that because i'd moved to ireland so yeah i mean depending on the therapist and depending on your intention like i i don't go into therapy thinking oh i'm gonna be in this therapeutic relationship for the next ten years i think that's ridiculous i think you go into therapy to um work on a specific problem and have a solution and have somebody be your sounding board who can see things that you can't see and you know work through that situation and come up with um a strategy for not just that not just creating a solution in that area but also just creating strategies and uh tools for the rest of your life so that you don't have to be in therapy forever <deep breath> <sigh> the last time i felt really happy <sigh> wow huh wow that's pretty sad um it was at least a year ago no i that's not true it was when i um saw my biological mother which was last may my best qualities um <sigh> i'm very strong very strong-willed i um am very supportive and loving and nurturing um i'm easy to be around i'm intelligent and um yeah anything i regret i don't think so no <sigh> don't take life too seriously <laughter> oh my ideal weekend um i spend some time at the beach i'll spend some time with friends um either going out at night you know to a movie or just going out to um a club or a bar or somewhere that we can just sit and chat and be together um maybe go dancing after um and sundays i usually go to scrubbed_entry and then i have brunch with friends and um yeah i go home and sunday night i get ready for the next day so hmm <sigh> i am most proud of um a few things i mean i've moved to places that i wanted to move to and uh so i've done things that have really spoken to me and have meant something you know been dear to my heart to actually um mm achieve those those um goals or those yeah i've done things that i've wanted to do like move to ireland and move to california mhm okay sure bye 
<synch> yes okay from santa monica uh the people mostly <sigh> well the people also <laughter> <laughter> uh no not a lot well i can't afford to travel as much as i'd like to mm i was an english major uh i just liked reading a lot at the time so it sounded like the best thing well the most fun thing to study no not anymore oh i guess my dream job would be to manage a uh soccer club oh it'd be pretty much impossible for me um i don't have any experience <laughter> in that field i'm very shy i play music <sigh> what do i do when i'm annoyed i don't know um what do i do when i'm annoyed i can't think of anything i don't know i don't think yeah i don't do anything specifically uh pretty good i would say very good i don't lose my temper very often mm when was the last time i argued with someone <sigh> i can't remember uh yeah i don't have a lot of conflicts with people i can't remember the last time i argued with someone <sigh> well let's see when i was um a little kid i was outside my grandparents' uh restaurant and there was a robbery and i saw it i well i saw it when when the robbers were leaving um yeah maybe i would want to erase that from my memory if i could well i didn't know what was happening in that moment so i didn't feel so bad at the time but i felt bad afterward because then um you know my mother was upset by it my mother was there and she had to call the police and it was it was disturbing to see her you know really disturbed that way but at the time that it actually happened i wasn't really upset it was more the the aftermath of it mm it was <wa> it was <laughter> <sigh> situation that <sniffle> <sigh> i don't know um well i can think of um there's probably a million situations that i would've <laughter> i wish i would've handled differently i can't think of one in particular um maybe i think that when i was a kid i um well i think that when i was let's see well i have okay i have a good one um i didn't marry the girl that i think that i should have married so that's a big one for me yeah well we <w> we were together for about four years and uh i think i just took her for granted and i just didn't uh commit and um that was a long time ago and now that's it's been so many years i realize well i don't know that if it's a realization but i think now that that yeah she should've been my wife that we were meant for each other or made for each other but because my selfishness and because i just uh had this fear of commitment at the time i just felt like i didn't uh i didn't do what i should've done what what the smart thing would've been <sigh> well the last thing i can think of that i would say i feel guilty about was <sigh> no i feel a lot of guilt about my my friendships i've not i don't feel like i'm as as good of a friend as i could be but then at the same time i don't really know exactly what uh how i could be a better friend i just feel a little guilty that i'm not that i can't help people anyone who who has a problem i can't i never feel like i can help anyone who i know who has a problem so oh that happens every day i guess it that happens with everyone who i know and everyone all of my relatives and all of my friends i don't feel like i can really give them anything or help them in their lives you know well they're um it's very distant it's it's just it's very cordial and it's very uh uh i don't know what the word is it's on the it's kept at a very surface level i don't think that they know i don't think that my family really knows me very well at all and uh i don't know them very well either not not in a not in a true sense so yeah it's it's i think a lot of families are that way but it it is it does bother me that mine is that way oh it's very easy i sleep a lot and i um yeah i i i have no problem sleeping at all no not not really i would say they way i am now it's the way i think i've been my whole life so even when i was a little kid i slept a lot also and no i don't think i've i've changed much mm pretty down but like i said in a way i could say yeah i'm feeling really down but then again i've always been this way so it's hard to say that's it's down when it's consistently that way yes a long oh a long time ago i was um about ten years old or around there about uh i was just missing a lot of school i didn't wanna go to school so eventually uh they sent me to to a therapist and then to a psychologist and then to a psychiatrist and uh it went from there no i haven't gone to therapy since i was a teenager well i didn't feel it was helping me at all so one day i just decided i didn't wanna go anymore eh uh well like i said it i didn't feel that it helped me um so i guess it i don't know that it affected me much no i wouldn't say disturbing no mm well i feel pretty happy whenever i see my nephew and uh i have a my best friend's children are i feel like they're my my nephew and my niece and i'm pretty happy when i'm around them uh my ideal weekend would be um i would travel <tr> i would probably be traveling i i would really enjoy just getting out of the city every weekend um eh going anywhere really just anywhere out of the city uh just seeing the way different people live and how people are different wherever you go i really do think people are different when you go to different places and how they interact with you and how they see the world different food um and i also like historical places i i'm into history and i and i enjoy um just visiting anywhere that has some sort of a historical significance <laughter> oh i haven't taken a trip in a long time um the last trip i really took was i went to france a few years ago for a wedding and i had a really good time there and i had always wanted to go to paris and so i got to go to paris and then i went to a little town um that's a few hours away from paris where the actual wedding was and yeah it was really fun i think the the church where the wedding was was uh like a thousand years old so yeah it was a really cool trip <sigh> <sigh> like i don't know i don't <laughter> i don't know what's what would would be considered memorable uh a memorable experience probably the most memorable experience i guess would just be nothing in particular but but living with the girl who i just who i told you earlier that i think now that we should've gotten married um that's something that stays in my memory that's why i'm saying it's memorable because it's it's still with me and um eh it's something that i don't think you know well i'll know i'll never forget it but it's not any mm particular day or any particular moment you know oh a lot um wish i could be healthier for one thing uh more energetic and um more friendly well no i think i am pretty friendly but more uh more outgoing more social <s> more uh more social um those two things mainly i guess i would like to be more more social more enthusiastic and more and healthier oh that's a good question my best friend how would my best friend describe me i think i think he would say that i'm a very <sigh> well it sounds cheesy but it <laughter> he would probably say that i'm a very spiritual person and that i'm very giving i i think i'm a lot more selfish than people think i am but people think that i'm not selfish um and probably he would say that i'm creative also <sigh> wow well my advice to to myself i don't understand the question <laughter> yeah but we already talked about it <sigh> nah i can't uh well i don't think that i really believe in in being proud or in in pride um i don't think that it accomplishments are really something to be proud of but i can't really think of any accomplishment anyway even if i did have something <laughter> to be proud of no i can't think of anything <anythi> any sort of accomplishment i've had <sigh> uh something i did recently that i really enjoyed well i sang karaoke with a couple of friends of mine <laughter> and i don't usually do that but yeah i had a that was a lot of fun a few days ago thank you     
<synch> sure i'm doing fine i'm from columbia south carolina yep uh two thousand four yeah <laughter> uh once a year for christmas break uh a lot slower paced more xxx i wanted to perform <perf> to pursue a film degree or i'm sorry a film career yes it's pretty challenging but it's uh fun uh i've always had a interest <inter> interest in uh film and movies so uh it seemed like a natural pick for me uh took about a couple of years but uh i feel like i'm pretty used to it now uh i like that uh it doesn't snow it's warm weather and there's lots do to with a lot of beaches uh the traffic and the cost of living is pretty high <laughter> i've never been outside of the u_s but uh i would love to at some point uh it depends on the situation i i can either be introverted or extroverted just given uh the right circumstance i like uh listening to music uh doing crossword puzzles reading and hanging out with friends on weekends uh very good hmm uh i don't think it was argument maybe <may> maybe a difference of opinion so it was more like a debate but uh it was pretty pretty tame uh i think it was a debate over sports over a basketball <ba> a basketball game and uh i was talking on facebook with somebody about it but i think it's good to uh express yourself if you have a difference of opinion it's uh it's natural to you know not always agree on things so i think talking <ta> talking about is healthy <hea> is healthy i have a very good relationship with my family um i get along with all of my family members and extended you know cousins and aunts and uncles so uh there's no one that i i've ever had any rifts with hmm with my family hmm i probably could've been more disciplined growing up and more uh more disciplined with schoolwork and homework that kinda thing but for the most part uh i had a i had a good childhood and uh there's not much i would change about it hmm probably leaving my comfort zone in uh south carolina moving out here that was pretty hard but at the same time it was uh exciting so it was it was a bittersweet feeling um a lot of excitement mixed with uh some anxiety but it uh it went away pretty quickly sure not doing better in school uh when i was in high school uh definitely i could've been a a <ss> um more diligent worker and i could've uh applied myself a little bit better hmm i've always had a strong support <s> uh family support system and uh parents and uh siblings so that's definitely a positive thing hmm an event uh probably going back to school i wish i would've uh wish i would've done better in school so if i could take something back from my past it would be uh scholastically <sch> scholastically related it's pretty easy when i don't sleep well um i tend to be kinda lackadaisical and uh just tired throughout the day kinda groggy uh no everything's pretty much uh the way it usually is with me i've been feeling pretty good uh no i have not uh no i haven't last time i felt really happy um i made a lot of money uh a few weeks ago and uh i feel like i'm ahead of the game with you know with having rent under control and a lot of bills out here so i'm still kinda have the lingering effects from that happiness yeah uh when i when i have money i tend to be a lot uh more even-tempered not even-tempered but i tend to feel better about things and more optimistic and this city being such about your finances it it always makes you feel good to be ahead of the game and to have uh xxx have sources of income uh i think i'm creative and i think i'm a good listener hmm to be as disciplined and focused as possible because once you're out of your parents' homes and out of their lives you have to depend on yourself and the better the better you do in school and the better you are um uh as far as discipline's concerned the more pleasurable <pleasur> pleasurable your life will be and a lot eh uh your life will be a lot easier hmm let's see here i wish i was more disciplined but i'm working on that and i've gotten a lot better at that it's become pretty easy i think i'm just getting older um i'm out of my twenties now so i definitely seen a change from when i first came out here hmm um some people tend to say that my decision to move out here was uh not feasible and kind of a pipe dream so that kinda made me feel bad but uh i kinda take insults in stride and um sometimes i welcome constructive criticism 'cause some some things are wrong with you that you're not aware of so as long as it's not mean-spirited and it's coming from the right place i think it could be an invaluable uh tool you know listening to what to what other people have to say that might be negative hmm uh probably optimistic and um outgoing optimistic and uh helpful my ideal weekend uh i would love to go to vegas and have a road trip with with three or four friends you know packed in the car and just uh lots of disposable income and um you know good weather uh i haven't been to vegas in probably five years but um i've gone to casinos with my brother and that's pretty fun sometimes uh i'm proud that i've come a long way from when i first moved out here i'm uh a lot more disciplined um i read a lot uh i do crosswords and i think i've i think i know what's important in life now and i'm more focused and going after what i want hmm i'm not a big fan of high taxes um but it doesn't really make me mad it makes me frustrated and and uh i guess i take it in stride though uh i had a friend over at my apartment and i watched a movie and that was fun it was a documentary a sport <s> a sports sure goodbye

<sync> yes i'm doing pretty well um i have some stressful circumstances going on but um um right now i'm i'm engaged i'm from minnesota mhm uh thirty one years ago half my life um frequently i've been back there quite a bit um but over the years not not that often um well it's a a whole different experience you know i i got back there to see my my family and and old friends and uh so it's uh l_a is is home it's nice to return here uh to be an actor uh i'm just actually getting around to it i was in another business for uh twenty five years and um now <clears throat> finally i can't put it off anymore um the economy um it's as easy to find work in uh show business it seems as it is any thing any of the other jobs i've done in the past um oh a whole variety of things um but mostly uh having to do with theater uh well to to be a successful actor you know would be nice and uh outgoing with elements of shyness um well i i i read and i cook and um um that's mm that's about it uh uh i oh i'm a big radio listener is uh to uh um talk radio uh national public radio and uh more uh and not uh crazy stuff um the sensible listening uh nice content uh interesting human interest uh mhm oh um well i'm i also i i um a comedian <cuh> comedian and so i like to listen to radio shows that have comedy mhm like uh um i'm pretty good i mean i'm not perfect but i i i i can get very upset oh probably with my wife about um my uh <clears throat> methods of of job hunting and like that it's um it's difficult um she uh um we're we're very different and uh have very different m_o's and uh so uh uh for me to uh um do things my way is is not always easy oh um well just the other night i i was uh performing in a nightclub and had an opportunity to uh introduce myself to a a very famous person and i um i didn't do it um uh i'm not sure i'm i guess uh i didn't know if it would be appropriate to approach him hm i can't think of uh i can't think of one um um well <clears throat> i've been married for it'll be twenty four years in uh july which is a couple of months and um uh my wife and i have not been sleeping in the same bed for about three years and um but we have a uh a very high achieving daughter who's going to graduate from high school uh this this spring and um she's just a uh gotten accepted at a college that she wants to go to with a very nice uh scholarship mhm um yeah well uh <laughter> my daughter's been very low maintainance for me um perhaps more so for my wife but she's always been uh an excellent uh uh child um mm <clears throat> well we're more similar i think than different uh i'm well i'm much more uh aware of what's happening in the world and and much more informed than my parents were um but uh as in terms of child rearing i think um i don't know we're all we've all been kind of hands off and um uh my wife has been more hands on um uh well the financial responsibility it um wanting to uh make sure that your child has everything that her peers have and uh not wanting her to uh um not have the same as her friends and she has uh very wealthy friends so that's um uh i am not a uh a gifted money maker and so uh it's a it's a a struggle but uh we we we keep on keep up um oh a couple of different um one preacher um uh whose church i attended for about twenty years until he died um um was very influential and also another spiritual guru uh um that uh sort of put me on a path to breaking patterns of behavior that uh were kind of dictated by my upbringing oh just um well instead of working for somebody else being able to um start a business and and be in business for yourself and and to uh um you know not be dependent on uh um just one source of income oh meeting one particular woman um when i first got out here um she left me uh less than healthy um physically and uh yeah um well i i self medicate to go to sleep which i probably don't have to do but i um uh about half the nights i i wake up um much earlier than i would like to oh usually um just mostly to have to go to the bathroom um um well i i i cope pretty well i i guess i'm just not quite as functional as i'd like to be um there are a couple of nights a week when i work until <sniff> two o clock from in the morning and don't get to bed until three and and then i um normally if i i i need seven hours if i only get five or six then i'm you know sluggish and um very anxious well um i have big um uh i have bills to pay and um not a lot of income coming in yeah it's um 'cause i don't like to fall behind and um i feel like i'm worried about losing ground and um the stakes are are high and uh so uh it's an uncomfortable position no um i am a classic um depressive uh and um yeah i guess i have i i guess i have i see <s> i do see a therapist and uh um though <clears throat> mm the mm therapist i'm seeing now is not trying to um prescribe drugs or medications um and uh previous ones have uh probably um six years ago um well my wife kind of pushed me into it um she thought um it was uh a way of i think getting help finding work and um it's not as uh it's just uh good <g> uh uh enjoyed uh having someone to talk to um not really yeah oh um just uh kind of not wanting to uh face the day just kind of wanting to um just uh kind of a weariness with the struggle uh and um just uh i displeasure with my life yes they're what i don't understand that word oh um well i um it's something i look forward to because um i i feel like i'm talking to someone who um understands me mm um i i can't i i don't know um um well each little um acting gig that i get makes me happy but uh you know just mildly happy and they usually turn out to be disappointing experiences and so um uh i never over excited <ex> excited um with happiness uh mm um well um yesterday i i made a a dessert uh to celebrate my daughter's uh scholarship and uh it was delicious and and we really enjoyed that mm um hm no um except meeting that one woman uh uh i don't know probably try a little harder you know <fidgeting with mic> uh i had started this business um um around that time and um it was it was um just it was difficult but uh we were successful at it and um uh i guess i could've gotten it rolling even more um so that it wouldn't be so um dead today oh um getting out of town um going going away when uh when uh which is rarely possible but uh yeah um well my daughter's a great source of pride and um um the fact that i've been pretty successful in uh my endeavors um and now i'm just uh going for the the big the big apple and uh uh and i hope to be successful there too okay you're welcome goodbye 
<synch> yes i'm doing fine california here in los angeles mhm um i love being near the beach um i love the beach i love um living in a big city um and i love the fact that i have lots of friends and family here mm traffic um just so many sometimes too many people but apart from that i i'm generally happy here photography and language studies mhm um i love photography i was always interested in it and studied it in high school as well so i wanted to continue to learn more about it and with languages i come from a mixed background so i wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background it's um it wasn't hard it was a passion so i enjoyed it i'm not no um to do photography full time and also to do some of the things that i'm passionate about um more creatively more creative things i have an idea i'd like to do um some <s> make some robe <r> ah like a robe line um women's robes and things like that mhm i have i've traveled quite a bit and i enjoy <en> i love travel um seeing different cultures different countries um meeting new people all of that and the language um i lived in greece for um <tisk> over a year i taught english there and um <sniffle> i moved around to different parts of greece and uh really had a great time i think um just having my group of friends that i met there and going through with the experience with them um i think one of my most memorable experiences was going to elafonisos in a car with everybody and um and having a just a fantastic time yes it was um i think i'm shy to begin with and um and as i get to know people then i'm much more outgoing photography and language studies <laughter> <deep breath> um i just stay at home uh maybe watch a movie um rest in bed watching a movie in bed that's probably one of the things that i like to do to relax i think very good <laughter> <deep breath> um it was probably with my boyfriend um uh regarding money issues um i need to i feel guilty about not generating as much income as i need to right now i'm having some struggles in my career right now and um financially it's becoming very difficult yeah it has been it's been difficult but i've been working very hard to um to remedy that <sigh> so well i'm here and um i'm doing this this focus study i'm doing um many things to generate more money working harder but looking for other ways to generate money outside of my my career um probably being raped no no sometimes um not that i'm aware of <deep breath> um i been feeling stressed <sigh> um i been feeling um <deep breath> been feeling stressed and and worried i don't seem to have any problem with it <laughter> i seem to get a good night's sleep almost every night mhm um grumpy and and lethargic and um in the morning hmm a situation i wish i would handle differently um i really can't think of one right now <laughter> the hardest decision um that i've ever had to make it was probably um deciding to not have a a child well um i was pregnant um and um wasn't sure <sigh> whether or not i should continue the pregancy um and that was also due to financial burden and um the father who i was involved with did not want the child so i made that very very difficult decision hmm <deep breath> really really happy <sigh> i know when i went to um cancun um on a holiday um over the new year um new year period new year holiday <deep breath> i felt <sigh> absolutely fantastic i felt happy i felt relaxed um i felt like i didn't have a care in the world temporarily um eh free <deep breath> um i wish i could um be a little bit stronger and more assertive definitely more assertive um i would say i'm a wonderful wonderful friend um mm i when i love somebody you know i love them very deeply friends family um boyfriend um so i think that's good i'm very loyal as a friend um i'm honest i care about people um i'm fun to be with so i think those are some of my best qualities <deep breath> um my relationship with my family um with my father is not so great um my parents were divorced when i was young and he's sort of been in and out of my life you know forever uh mostly out so that's um it's not fantastic but um but it's something that i'm used to so it's not as painful as it would be had he been there and then i lost him but it's it's still it's still um it's still not the best situation i mean i still wish that could be um remedied somehow scrubbed_entry so there's good and and bad relationships in my family scrubbed_entry someone that's been there for me since i was very very young and has always been just incredible and i love her so much <deep breath> um ten or twenty years ago um i would've told myself to work harder then and not have so much fun so i don't have to work so hard now i i regret exactly that i regret um not taking my career seriously earlier on um because now it's it's been um it's been much harder um i think it was taking the kids to the pier um and spending some wonderful time with them and making them happy that was probably a great time um one of the best times in the last few weeks scrubbed_entry and uh and they're they're great kids um no i think the they're it's challenging um it is more difficult because they're stepchildren so there are some um times when i'm not sure exactly how much um to get involved and how much not to get involved but i'm we're very lucky because they are really good kids they do tend to fight a lot but um but i but it's not as difficult as um as i think some other parents have it mhm <deep breath> um i made it make a make a conscious effort not to um <laughter> not to punish them um or over-punish them i make a conscious decision not to um scream at them the way that i was screamed at i was screamed at a lot as a child and um it was really it was really difficult so i make sure not to do that um i think i'm most proud of the fact that i've um been able to travel the world um and live in other places many many other places um around the country and around the world and um the fact that um i learned several languages um and the fact that i've been able to maintain um really long long long relationships with my friends thank you goodbye 
<sync> yes i'm doing really good i'm from granada hills california it's um the san fernando valley part of los angeles i love the weather i like the diversity in people i like how you can go to a neighborhood and it's just not just one race or kind of food i love the beaches all the activities you could go do theme parks aquariums stuff like that museums the smog um there's a lot of creepy guys <laughter> <laughter> i've pretty much traveled around l_a i've been cross country and back three times twice was when i was seventeen i like meeting new people and trying different foods and seeing how other people live um when i was seventeen i ran away with my boyfriend to upstate new york to watertown it was uh like a navy army kind of town we had an apartment there it snowed a lot we sold antiques for a living <laughter> um getting passes press passes for the sunset strip music festival through a friend and getting to meet rockstars and hang out at like the private parties <laughter> i'm very outgoing i love people um i go to the gym and work out quite a bit i find it helps relieve stress and keeps my energy level going i realized <rea> noticed if i don't work out a couple days i feel a little more tired than normal and it just helps me feel good i'm pretty good at it i'm very calm um i worked a lot of events and jobs where you're dealing with like thousands of people a day and people you need to talk to and you have to remain calm and you know they're the customers so you have to make them feel wanted and good and realize that you're getting paid 'cause the money they're spending so i'm good at resolving <reso> resolving like consumer conflicts and stuff on the job i had a drunk friend that was just falling around and yelling and saying rude things to people and i kinda started getting loud like just telling her to stop doing that and that she was embarrasing and what she was saying to people was very mean you know and i wonder like if you're talking to people like that they might not like it and they could attack you or something you know you never know it is l_a <laughter> i really don't feel guilty about anything decisions i've made in my life i've think i've made really good decisions and i always stick with my moral compass what i'm doing i grew up in church so i haven't gone in years but i still have those values and you know the rules the ten commandments and stuff in my head i had a slum lord landlord and um i wish that i called you know the proper authorities and followed through on a court case instead of letting him like kind of bully me out because it wasn't up to code i a few years back i was dating a guy and he wanted me to move back  to where he was from and after a few months you know he was coming to l_a and going back home i decided to move there and i had just started you know this business i was doing event planning was picking up and i decided to leave there and try to do it there and  you know on the east coast and it didn't work out but it was tough deciding like should i leave l_a and make this jump and trace something new and experience something new or stay in what i was doing i was i had a degree in dental assisting i did that for like a year i didn't like it and then i was studying communications like radio and television broadcasting and journalism um somewhat i'm doing event work and i wrote for a magazine a couple years and i'm trying to like get a website going and then have like where i'm controlling my own writing and what's going on instead of you know writing <wri> writing for someone else i always wanted to write and was always into the news and music and art growing up i really like connie chung she was like a channel four newscaster in the eighties and i love barbara walters i was a nerd no <laughter> um my sister she doesn't talk to any of the family and i have a good relationship with my mom um i never really knew my dad it doesn't bother me i have cousins and stuff but everyone's scattered across the country so i don't really talk to them on the phone we just communicate on facebook  or like twitter oh i go right to sleep when i get tired i just go to sleep pretty good energetic i've been motivated to go look for more event work you know event planning stuff and really grinding in more than i was i mean it's kinda hard 'cause you gotta talk to people and get them to trust you and see that you could plan events and meet people and convince them why they should pay you to do their event than someone else no no i mean i'm generally pretty happy unless something devastating happens like someone gets cancer or someone i know dies i wouldn't say that i'm just super like oh my god happy all the time but it's like an even keel that i feel pretty good all the time i'm very talkative and friendly and i could approach strangers and talk to them at ease and i could adapt to different situations and even if i it's not my scene or situation or group of people that i'm used to i could still jump in talk to people and be comfortable and make friends and adapt i wanna make more money <laughter> <laughter> i remember in like second grade this people used to make fun of me 'cause i was very tall and skinny and i had like straight a's one of the highest grades in the class so people would make fun of me and call me giraffe or stuff like that <laughter> very talkative she would just say that i talk to everyone <laughter> and that i'm very friendly and if you need help that i'll help someone you know oh recently i went up to oceanside and visited a friend i've known years and we just went out for burgers and hung out on the beach and we got her two year old son and like took him to the park and played and it was really nice and it was cool visiting her i hadn't seen her in six months and it was really fun and i wanna go again and i like the area mhm i guess maybe i could be trying to find my own work more like for my business instead of working for other people i think i pursue it but i think maybe i could put a little more time a day into it i don't really know anything like that i would wanna erase or not happen no i feel good about my choices i've made and i think i'm on the right path and a lot of things i wanted to do then balls rolling and i'm getting <g> you know getting things done i'm not as big as i wanna be but i feel like i'm on my way there um like ten years ago i would've told myself to work more in the daytime instead of going out as much as i was um my friend we call mojo <laughter> um mojo has a magazine and i just wrote years and he really pushes me to like keep writing and keep doing events and keep on the ball i'm rolling and he's one of the biggest people you know in my life telling me you're talented you could do it you know he's just a really good like motivation for me <laughter> you know being published i've been on t_v shows and just getting my own event thing going and i have a lot of people who read what i write every day and follow on i just think it's a you know it's not exactly kinda where i wanna be but it's a great start and i worked to get to that point great thanks <laughter> 
<sync> yes doing good new york city well uh originally i was born here but uh spent some time back east and um moved back here and um basically sort of raised here so been here a while and i'm enjoying it there's great weather and um uh amusement parks a lot of scenery a lot of people uh a lot of energy and excitement there's so many things to really like about l_a see uh a lot of congestion and pollution i i try to but no i don't uh it's nice to be on the open road with uh mm potentially <potelingly>  time to think about my own life shy sometimes i find it hard to express my own thoughts well you mentioned a fish tank and uh i view spent some time in a many waiting rooms where there's been fishtanks and uh uh so staring at fishtanks could be one of them uh but i also enjoy walking or uh lifting weights reading going to movies just to say a few things uh good moderate uh good um in control argued about today okay last argument was today just before i got here and it was about um having about how do i say this about taking them to a bus stop about uh how uh making an arrangement feel guilty about not taking better care of my pet sure i i like birds so one of my pets was a bird uh as of recently and i let my bird out into the wild and sort of wish i had planned for better um future for the for the bird uh only because now i sort of wish the bird was uh closer to me hm i would say i get into arguments with people close to me friends and sometimes i i don't handle them well i am more reactive so i wish uh i'd like to see myself improve on that uh no um at least not you know in any sort of legal trouble but uh i think it's you know it's kind of not the way that i would like to have handled it guess the hardest decision was about to of how to proceed with moving forward eh on a job opportunity i had to decide whether if i would suffer more emotional pain by leaving my family and whether the financial gain and uh knowledge of that experience would over outweigh the benefit uh yes yes i am well i it's a small family but um have a mother and a uh sister and a brother and uh two younger nieces older they're they're grown adults uh it's a it's a good relationship and uh things could be better um sometimes it's sort of difficult pain staking uh relationship at times there's uh some days i'm i need time for myself and i would rather give the time to other people rather than to take time for myself which has been my experience uh and so that has caused me a lot me a lot of emotional pain uh a little bit of spiritual uh anxiety about my future if i continue to do that sort of thing wow there's so many things <laughter> what about you i don't know anything about you i would say uh well there's there's a few um but of recent i um well things are going pretty good i'm can't really say there's anything as of yet that i would really want to change or or have anything to regret on that i can remember it's been pretty good and uh it's uh i'd say it's okay uh i'm handling my sleep pretty well when i don't sleep well sometimes i can be irritable um sometimes it's okay uh and uh would say if there's also times where i'm unhappy so i try to get as much sleep as i need yes i believe i was uh nineteen and uh i'm glad i did it yes uh sort of but uh yes no um well uh i guess i suppose it made me a more confident person and more um in tune with uh uh the country that i'm living in and people uh to be more noticeable more watchful of where i live um hanging out with some friends uh on a really nice weekend and uh on a boat uh or on a skiff a really small boat and um trying to fish in i felt uh free or alive um happy um uninhibited uh strong confident uh mature after the military uh after military took some time to evaluate my my thoughts and uh my future and um just sort of took uh the necessary steps uh to move ahead uh it's sort of hard it is um uh it wasn't easy uh a lot of family uh help and um and community and uh so it took some adjusting but it wasn't easy uh no no uh you know this week um partially today happy's uh happy sort of often not too happy but content happy happy i don't know uh not usually too happy try to stay on the center line do a weekend um up early um get out enjoy the day um hook up with some friends and uh doing a little bit of socializing and uh maybe get some form of uh view some form of artistic expression there's a maybe a like a museum or uh stare at some art or uh maybe something in the local community maybe street art and uh or perhaps something with music or uh something something of that nature i wish perhaps uh some things that i could change about myself um make more decisive about decisions and uh something else um that i had the same ability for a knack for uh for meeting more people i suppose as best friends describe me i don't know um nice friendly uh trustworthy sociable uh the same advice i'd give myself <laughter> today something wow uh i really enjoy spending time with my girlfriend and her two children and that was yesterday and i'm glad i did that it was a good time for everybody uh i'm proud i went into the military and um i'm glad i did that it was a good experience bye thank you 
 <synch> <laughter> yes i'm doing good i'm originally from southern california i like the um downtown theater district i like the beaches i i like the variety of stuff that you can do in one day <clears throat> hmm well sometimes i don't like the traffic i don't think there's really too much i don't like about l_a i really do like l_a though <laughter> no i i haven't really traveled in about um five years oh i just haven't been able to travel um i just haven't traveled <laughter> <deep breath> um i like going to new places and seeing things i haven't seen before and if i can like visiting um places like landmarks well the last one i did was san francisco that wasn't so far but i got to stay in downtown san francisco and i got to go shopping and i got to get on a um the street car so that was cool xxx well i still study i'm studying psychology mhm hmm well <sigh> i decided to go back to school um just pretty quickly so i went to junior college and then when it got close to graduate i knew i wanna transfer so i'd taken a a couple psychology courses and i decided i liked it so i just decided to make that my major and it i thought it didn't have a lot of math but it had enough math <laughter> so <deep breath> mm <sigh> well now that i'm almost done i don't know if i'm gonna continue in that area well what i wanted initially was to um <sigh> get into sports psychology but i'm not quite sure that's what i want either well i could be shy initially but um once you get to know me i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> <sigh> i think i either go to sleep eat something really really good or watch something on netflix well just a good movie i like foreign movies a lot um so a lotta right now i'm into um martial arts movie with subtitles so i think i'm pretty good hmm you know i know they're not really long arguments i don't know if they're real arguments i know i argued with my boyfriend um <laughter> 'cause he hung up in my face but i don't know why and it got solved pretty quickly so i don't know if it was really that important wait i walked out without say oh okay hmm i can't think of one right now <sigh> i think the hardest decision i probably had to make was moving from well back to california from oregon well i was really young so i was um nineteen twenty-ish and i was really by myself so that was pretty hard 'cause obviously i had to support myself because it was really really boring in oregon so um i really like the activity here in l_a you know i don't really feel guilty about many things well i don't talk to them that much um my dad my stepmom live in oregon so i probably talk to 'em on the phone at least once or twice a month and then when they come out here i wanna say at least once a year sometimes it can be twice you know occasionally more but not too often then i see them um that's about it but i'm pretty much the only one out here my brother is also up there as well yeah hmm well i've had lots of positive influences i think um just regular people i come across you know maybe someone i've worked with maybe um like oh actually my uncle he's a really good positive influence he um he knows quite a bit has lots of good advice mm about <bout> life hmm you know i don't really think i've had anything that bad happen to me where i just don't uh where it bothers me so much i have to not think about it pretty <pret> well i can't say pretty easy 'cause i work odd schedule and then i go to school but um yeah if i wanna go to sleep i sleep really well though as long as i have enough you know hours really really happy and good <laughter> nope no <deep breath> i'm always happy uh <laughter> gosh yesterday um i'm just happy any time i talk to my boyfriend or if i go out and do something i'm just happy um i got off work i'm happy 'cause i'm done for the day i'm just really happy um i'm on spring break i'm really happy right now so <deep breath> hmm <sigh> oh i haven't done like any really extremely fun activities unless you consider going out to eat but the last activity that i had a lot of fun doing was ice skating um in december downtown <dow> in downtown l_a no i don't really have too many regrets i mean whatever happens happens and you know it was meant to play out that way hmm well um i guess i would say don't worry too much about the small things um even though they seem really big it really they really are insignificant and uh you won't think about it six months from now i think my best qualities are i'm a happy person i'm a fun person i'm pretty easy to get along with i think most people like me and i'm just a cool person hmm well i wish i could study more i wish i would study more i wish that uh <sigh> i would exercise more and i wish that uh that's yeah i think that's it right there hmm <sigh> i don't think i wanna talk about that hmm i don't know i guess uh just taking care of myself supporting myself not having to go back home i guess that's about the best accomplishment there is thank you bye 
<sync> yes i'm doing okay i'm from greenwich connecticut yes um i moved here in two thousand eight so about five years ago um i try to go back at least once a year sometimes i go more sometimes less um overall i think i like where i'm from better than l_a in general um i think that other than it being somewhere i'm familiar with the type of people that are there are just more my type and what i'm used to and it's less superficial <tisk> um i moved out here for college after i graduated high school and my mom and sister live in california um initially it was easy because i felt like it was a new experience so you kind of adapt and just are experiencing everything at once but then after the first few years when it really sets in how different it is and what life is out here it became more difficult than originally uh fine arts and photography um i was interested in photography since high school um i did a lot of programs and got awards and things like that and publishments so i decided to pursue art um yes i have a fine arts degree that i got last year and scrubbed_entry yeah i really enjoy working or interning in forensics um i like that better than initially what i wanted to do was freelance photography i feel like it's a more secure job and it's very interesting um that's a interesting question i guess just my childhood in general growing up um well my family's very close um my extended family as well and they all live <li> most of them live within the area or in the east coast in general so we would always do large family uh parties and things for holidays and religious purposes and things like that yeah it is really fun and we try and all get together as much as possible which is more difficult now since everyone is spread out amongst different states and countries um i consider myself more shy um i watch reality television i think it's kind of funny and lighthearted um i watch like bravo t_v like the real housewives shows and just like funny things that you don't really need to pay attention to um i'm good i guess i don't really have like a temper if i'm having if i'm more stressed out it it definitely shows in in my attitude it but i don't really have like anger um well me and my boyfriend like bicker all the time <laughter> just like about like insignificant things but other than that um i had an argument with my dad a few days ago um there's been like some tension going on since i went and visited over the holidays this past winter things about his girlfriend and he thinks that i should be the one to make some kind of effort to have a relationship with her although he doesn't for whatever reason think that it should go both ways so for like the thirtieth time he we were on the phone and he was <sigh> telling me how i need to call her and speak to her and i told him that i was going to do it over this past weekend 'cause of the jewish holidays and he kind of was just like very mature and telling me oh forget it she doesn't want to hear from you now and kind of just like i could care less because i i don't care about having a relationship with her so if she doesn't wanna hear from me you know it's easier for me um i mean every time <t> i mean it's been the same recurring argument a lot and i wish that i could sometimes i do but i wish that the times that it turns into an explosive fight that i could just bite my tongue but the thing is is that he says certain things that are untrue or things he knows that like will tick me off that are really nasty and that he shouldn't be saying to me so he so i kind of just like lose it and i can't really mm like not say anything um well i guess the hardest decision i made which i it didn't i only realized that it's the hardest decision like looking back is once you decide where to after you graduate high school where to go to college because for me i basically changed my entire life and moved away and did all that on my own so it didn't seem like that hard of a decision at the time it felt like just like a progression of the next step but looking back now that's probably one of the hardest decisions i made um well i wish i could erase the event or seeing my grandmother's funeral which obviously it wouldn't change anything but it wasn't seeing her there was not something i'd wanna like have in my memory um she was she was a very positive influence and always was not judgmental um and now i mean my parents are great role models just in general i mean they're very successful people so whether or not we have like disagreements or that we're separate people they kind of are good role models in terms of what you wanna have when you are older um usually it's easy the problem is staying alseep no matter how late i go to bed whether it's ten p_m or four a_m i will be up like clockwork by seven thirty or eight o'clock in the morning the latest every single day and i can't seem to figure out why i cannot stay asleep longer no i just in the morning i guess i'm a lighter sleeper but i just wake up like i just cannot stay asleep anymore which never used to be a problem this consistent but now it's i cannot remember the last time i slept past eight thirty in the morning <tisk> i mean it just makes if i have to do stuff during the day it makes it a lot more tiring but it doesn't really i'm so used to it now it doesn't really change my mood it's just part of everyday um i don't know i kind of just feel very mm like so so just no extreme highs no extreme lows it's kind of one note land i mean nothing like lately um like recently it's just i would say over a period of years i've kind of progressively become more seclusive and just reserved and not very outgoing no no i have been diagnosed with anxiety um i had some breathing problems for a day or two and i had to go to the hospital um 'cause i thought it was more serious 'cause i couldn't breathe but they said that it was a physical manifestation of my anxiety i think in the right setting and with the person who's doing it if they're open minded and the therapist is helpful and good at what they're doing then yeah no i haven't been to therapy since i was a kid um i went because my parents thought it would be a good idea to like deal with whatever issues they were having with me but it was never i mean we just sat around and talked about my day it wasn't i didn't feel like i needed therapy at the time so i didn't really get much out of it <sigh> well i was happy when i was back home at my boyfriend's house with his family over the new year's holiday when i'm there i can always just we save up our money so it's a complete vacation i don't have to worry about paying bills i don't have to worry about what i have to do tomorrow who i have to deal with i just every morning we wake up we hang out just enjoy the day in general um i regret the college i chose to go to i didn't being from the east coast the whole collegiate system is set up a lot differently and the universities out there are not the same as the tight knit california school system out here so when i was researching colleges i kind of thought that santa monica college was just a general college just like boston college back home or you know any other school with the name college at the end of it i didn't realize until you know the end of my first year even that it was more like a transfer school like you you can't i didn't even realize you couldn't get a bachelor's degree from there when i went so it kind of create created more problems for me <sigh> well considering i'm twenty two <sigh> i'd probably say ten years ago i would give myself the advice to probably stay closer to home and to have really pursued other options rather than just be completely invested in moving to california um my best friend would describe me as a great charismatic funny outgoing socially enjoyable person which is different than how people who aren't my good friends would describe me which i mean i don't i mean it is what it is i am very outgoing and and have a great time when i'm with my friends in my element but around strangers and in like uncomfortable groups and things i just i am very shy and don't really speak much um recently my friend was visiting and we went to a clippers basketball game a few weeks ago and i really enjoyed that yeah um i'm very caring i i'm a very good judge of character which i mean i guess i mean i consider it to be a quality <qu> quality for myself um i'm very affectionate <aff> i mean i'm not very affectionate i'm more i mean i guess i guess so thanks 
<sync> yes i'm okay uh los angeles <laughter> um i don't know <laughter> um it's kinda dirty but that's to be expected from a big city um my the last class that i took was a sociology class um i'm not <n> i'm not really sure where i'm going with school but i'm thinking about sex education i think that it's a really important job um uh i feel like uh because there's kind of uh stigma i guess about talking about sex it leads to like a lot of unsafe sex and a lot of unplanned pregnancies so i feel like it's a very important job for the world <laughter> i don't know <laughter> no um lack of funds um it depends on the people but i'd say that uh generally i'm more shy uh of course with people who i know well like they're closer to me i i'm more outgoing um play with my dogs uh i don't know uh if it's a nice day i'll go for a walk um if it's not a nice day then or if it's cold out or something then uh maybe watch a show on t_v i like or read a book or something i'd say i'm pretty good at controlling my temper um i can't remember i think the last person i argued with was my boyfriend probably last week but i don't even remember what it was about <laughter> um i don't think i really feel guilty about anything i'd say that i regret things but i think there's a difference between guilt and regret um like i think guilt is more just like feeling bad but regret is like um feeling like you should've made a different decision and i think that can help you in to make better decisions in the future whereas guilt you just feel bad for no reason and it's useless <laughter> um i regret not doing better uh when i was in high school um uh i mean not getting better grades um i regret uh like getting involved with certain people in the past but i mean i don't i'm not sure <laughter> that's about it that i can think of right now <laughter> hm um uh yeah i mean i mean in the past uh yeah i could've made different decisions i mean obviously some things you know you aren't entirely in your control but i'm not going to feel i'm not going to regret things that i had no power over so um i'm not sure if i would want to erase it from my memory but i wish that it didn't happen to me uh was uh the time that i was raped <laughter> i can't really think of any hard decisions um hm i can't think of any <laughter> hm i'm not sure <laughter> i can't think of any uh i have a pretty good relationship with my family um uh not i wouldn't say that i'm really close with my mother but i mean we get along well and i'm very close with my sister we're basically best friends um hm i think that my mother has been a positive influence in my life uh because she was always able to provide for me and she always she didn't i mean she made like mistakes sometimes but i think that she was always there for me when i needed it and um she just did her best to raise me so i think she was a big positive influence uh it's been easy lately uh sometimes i have trouble sleeping but uh lately i have had no problems um it depends how long i've gone without sleep i can just be anywhere from like groggy to like um really on edge and like um extremely tired <laughter> i don't know um i have been feeling pretty good i uh i have like general anxiety kind of all the time but it's not as bad as it has been in the past so been feeling mostly pretty good um i think that i've actually been feeling happier lately i wouldn't say that i'm like really happy all the time i mostly just kind of like um neutral but i have been feeling more positive lately i'm actually not sure if i've been diagnosed with p_t_s_d um uh i know that i i've been seeing uh psychologist <psyc> psychologists for like since i was sixteen um for depression and uh i think my first psychologist who i saw for a few years thought that i had p_t_s_d but i'm not sure if she ever made a diagnosis um i'm not sure <laughter> uh i'm <laughter> i don't know yes um it's helpful to uh talk someone and have them kind of um guide you in talking about something so that you can figure thing the figure out your feelings about things sort of i guess for yourself or like why it it helps to talk with somebody because you can figure out why you're feeling a certain way about something i mean i think sometimes you can do that on your own but uh talking to somebody helps i think um hm i'm not sure <laughter> um i'm not sure <laughter> um i'm not sure <laughter> uh i think i would spend it mostly at home um but it would be sunny out and i would go outside a little bit and i'd play with my dogs and uh i'd probably have my boyfriend over um i'd eat food that i like like only food that i like like my favorite foods um watch movie or t_v show that i like um just kind of have like a relaxing time but that's nice mm i would tell myself to uh to uh to do better in school because throughout high school i was kind of an underachiever and i ended up going to community college like on and off because i would like sort of lose interest and then uh not do well or as well as i could have so i would tell myself to do as well as i could in school because i feel like i am capable of a lot more than i do and i think i could easily have gotten a scholarship <schol> a scholarship if i had done well in high school so i would just tell myself to do good in school probably warn myself about one or two people that turned out to be not worth my time <laughter> um hm um i think i am proud of myself for not being um bitter and for wanting to uh well i am kind of bitter i guess but i guess i'm proud of myself for not being selfish and wanting to um make the world a better place like 'cause a lot of bad things have happened to me and i try to instead instead of dwell on them i try to um or i want to be able to make things better for other people and as much as i wanna help i guess um empower people to make their lives better bye

dream job hm mm my dream job hm i don't really have one right now no i don't and i can't even see your shoes um um listen to music watch horror movies i love <luh> i love horror flicks um and i have a fish tank too so i like to watch my fish also like to play tennis when i can i haven't been able to play lately though because of physical problems um mm it's just that um i had injured uh my my my ankle because i have anemia <aneenia> and um and i got dizzy one night and i fell on my ankle and on my leg and so i'm just waiting for that to really heal but i'm planning to get back um into tennis it's one of the things i enjoy doing it really relaxes me i really don't have a temper over the years i've learned how to do how to control that probably would've been yesterday but there was no argument and what was it about nothing that i can recall <laughter> something i feel guilty about hm there's nothing right now that i feel guilty about mm oh a situation that i wish i had handled differently i really can't think of one right now the hardest decision oh um the absolute hardest decision that i ever had to make um was when my uh i had twins twin twin twin boys they're grown now i had twins twin teen teenagers and um i had lost my job and we were living in a motel and the rent for the motel was outrageous i couldn't no longer continue to pay the um pay the type the type of money that they wanted so i had to briefly um um put my son under the in in foster care for for for a minute that was the hardest decision that i had to make scrubbed_entry um a schizophrenic and he had had um he was born with auditory processing deficit which he overcame through training with a speech therapist and and school officials and he also this is he also lost his hearing when he was four years old um but and then when he turned fourteen the schizophrenia came up um so right now he he's in a supportive living environment he's twenty seven years old um but he he he's come to terms with his mental illness and he accepts it now i had problems in the past 'cause he didn't wanna take the medication you'd give him the medication and he'd hide it stick it in his pocket or whatever so but he's come to terms with that and we've all have come to terms with that and he's doing he's doing pretty good scrubbed_entry um that son he's twenty <twen> he's twenty seven as i said 'cause he's a twin um um was living in texas with his wife and um he got a promotion to um scrubbed_entry now he's in california too both are in california okay so um i feel very good about that yeah uh hm well of grown children yes <laughter> of grown children yes no no no no no no no no i take that back not it's not hard to be a parent of grown of my grown children okay when they were younger there were difficult times okay difficult periods and um just it was a lot of good times too but yeah it was there were some difficult times mm well the mm the difficult times i really pretty much already alluded to and that was when um one of my twins got the diagnosis of schizophrenic and um and um they were in temporarily and in in well one was in foster care and one was actually um in a institution 'cause of the um the um schizophrenia um so think i lost track of the question <laughter> the hardest thing about being a parent at this point at this <the> at this point in my life there is is nothing hard about it um the best thing about being a parent i don't know i guess it's just to see <cough> something that you created um develop into a you know pretty decent human being you know a decent person that's the best thing oh a lot of ways um well actually i didn't have two parents i had a mother and the father was never in my father was never in the home and he lived in another state so i had no contact with him um but the thing that i do differently than what my mother did um she was a strong disciplinarian um both verbally and physically um and she at she had this tendency which she outgrew she had this tendency to be very critical okay critical and um um opinionated <laughter> and very religious um and sort of sort of looked at people who were not and that was me um as if they were living life wrong because they were not going to church or reading the bible and that kind of thing what was the other part of the question i i i don't get a good night's sleep or i don't sleep at all unless i take medication and that's that that's all there is to it if i don't take medication i don't sleep i'll be up all night i'll i will be up for days if i don't take medication man irritable um and tired <laughter> well well lately you know just a little anxious really um you know um i just recently um made a move to a new apartment it's a lot of expenses and new expenses and things like that you know and new furniture and new this and that that you have to get which um i've i managed to do all of that but um the whole thing was kind of stressful yes mhm no not p_t_s_d yes um that was back in i think two thousand and four um because um my life had gotten so stressful to the point where it was either i had to do something or or end something to tell you the truth yeah um yes mhm yeah i think it's useful um you know as a good sounding board you know someone to throw you know your concerns out and you know discuss things that may be bothering you or good things too yeah i think therapy with medication um since i've been going to therapy um the changes a lot of changes um i've been more focused more hopeful um hm it it's just been a good experience for me which is why i continue to go really happy well i can feel really happy um by some occurrence i can't think of anything right now just like that and then i go back to how i was feeling so i can't really pinpoint anything really i mean eh eh i mean if something comes to me unexpectedly or if things go right for a change and continue to go right as opposed to things going wrong all the time that that makes me happy when things go right how about that hm mm something i did recently that i really something i did recently that i really enjoyed mean really really enjoyed recently hm i can't think of anything i don't have a best friend um my best qualities are that i'm a honest person i genuinely give people the benefit of the doubt um everyone in my book is as they appear to be until they prove prove it differently um i'm very generous overly generous <laughter> um and i'm very i like to help other people i mean help you know i'm on a personal level help people you know with anything whatever their problem is it gives me pleasure to do something for somebody else that's helping them out mhm anything i regret how so there's only one thing i regret and that is that um after my twins became um became old enough to um start going to um school the elementary school level um i was taking some courses um as a pre law major and um at that time i was married to their father who who turned out not to be a good fit for me and because of the stresses involved with him you know knowing that that was gonna end and i was gonna leave him um i dropped out of college so that was my biggest regret hm stay in school no matter what stay the course no matter what that i'm a good person i'm a good human being that's all okay goodbye 
<synch> mm yes i am um i'm okay chicago um back and forth over the years and traveled a little bit haven't been out there in over fifteen sixteen years um kinda got stuck out here <laughter> then i had my baby and i just stayed uh different food um the people get along way um how do i get it it's kind of a culture shock uh out there just on the food basis they like to give you a lotta food that tastes real good for a little bit of money to keep a lifelong customer but out here they wanna go up there and give you a little bit of food for a whole lotta money so they just making money <laughter> um mm parent had business out here um not hard i could get used to anywhere the views and the ocean uh just uh a splitting of people that's it <laughter> um just a few places getting to see different people and learn how different people get along and interact with each other <laughter> um <laughter> uh <sigh> i remember a trip years ago where i went to mexico with my brother yeah um jumping into a lake <laughter> pretty much off the side of a mountain <laughter> yeah everything <laughter> there's not a subject i don't like um actually my dream job working with computers and helping people that's where <wh> where my heart is i like computers and i also like helping people <laughter> i meditate um work out i run i walk um i write read in the median mm i'd say very good oh yeah that doesn't make it seem that good <laughter> um last time i argued was over someone actually spitting out a racial slur towards my um wife angry upset hurt disrespected and especially when i went up there to treat the person actually i was treating 'em with dignity and respect and trying to help the person at first it's no problem people are people mm i had a chance in school to really go a lot further than i did and i let something very small and meaningless stop me in the pursuit of it um <laughter> ignorance <laughter> for lack of a better word now that i think back on it i could've done a whole lot to avoid it but i was just young and foolish to start living again <deep breath> <sigh> um as much pain as i've seen in the world um a compilation of all the events uh just different bad things that i've seen i if i could change it i would but sometimes i guess things are there for a reason even though we may not understand it <laughter> um i have no answer to that um blood family we really don't talk um my wife don't know if she really wants to be there with me or not she thinks that i'm doing everything in the world but that i'm not and really <laughter> i don't understand i know my daughter loves me but i don't know if she wants to be with me or not because when somebody talks to you when they say something a certain amount of times and the tonage in they voice and the belief in their eyes if you say something so many times it's what really lies in your heart <sharp inhale> so you could say whatever through your mouth but it's what really is there hmm i love my daughter she a angel i cut her umbilical cord i went out there and <laughter> put on her first shirt i seen her come out she looked at me right out the stomach <laughter> she wouldn't she was fighting with the doctors wouldn't let 'em touch her a bit i talked to her i told her to calm down or i told her it was daddy she looked up at me grabbed my fingers and like just calmed down and just let 'em do everything they needed to do <laughter> no it's constantly changing task um what you have to do on this day won't be the same thing as the next or the next after that it's constantly um what is a better word for it um <laughter> um adjusting <laughter> um the hardest thing i'll probably say is scolding your child because you know you're doing it out of love for 'em not xxx learn the wrong lessons <laughter> seeing your baby smile in appreciation i try to guard my baby a lot more from things that she sees um when i was younger there were a lotta things that i seen that no child or adult should've seen and um when <whe> i grew up i swore to myself that i'll always take care of my child and i wouldn't disappear or let her be around things like that um my old foster parents mm they basically showed me no matter where you come from you can always strive to get better um a good night's sleep eh um it comes <laughter> the same just tired and yawning <laughter> how have i been feeling mm like i have a wealth of queries and a wealth of gold within my grasp and it's just right out of my reach because i just need that one connector to really just see what i'm capable of and i know i'm capable of a lot it's just i need to make that connection no <sigh> um mm not p_t_s_d no uh i said yes but i don't figure i'm any more depressed or anything than any other person everyone has their different breaking points my daughter's birthday on the twenty sixth um took her out to chuck e cheese she had fun she played games she was on bikes <deep breath> she was crawling through puzzle games um man this girl did about everything <laughter> um fun loyal caring <sigh> um something to change i would like to be more accurate <sigh> not getting to know who my mom was stop thinking about whatever else has happened and just do what you need to do i'm positive i'm goal-oriented determined um i'm very imaginative very creative <laughter> ideal i would probably be doing a little bit of everything rock climbing biking hiking going with my daughter places um <laughter> man i'll probably be skiing snowboarding and everything <laughter> in a ideal weekend my daughter no problem goodbye 
<synch> hi sure alright uh originally originally i'm from uh korea mhm uh when i was a year old yes uh almost never i've i've been to korea once uh i love the weather <sigh> and being by the ocean and the culture has a lotta things to do the food there's a lot to like um the traffic um it seems like we're having a lot of uh economic difficulties and the the parking tickets are super high i sometimes i'm really annoyed by our government <laughter> by your shoes did you say by your shoes <laughter> your shoes aren't showing um i have traveled a bit i'm i'm sort of traveled i haven't traveled in a little bit in a little while oh just <sigh> it um it helps you keep things in perspective about our life here um it's exciting and it makes me feel like um i'm actually <act> i'm really living 'cause sometimes we're stuck in this bubble here in l_a and seeing other places you realize that you know life is about a lotta different things that you don't think about every day well um one of my trips i went uh i went to singapore and then to thailand and it was when i was with my ex-boyfriend and we went to um he had <ha> he was uh uh a sales engineer or systems engineer but he he did well that year and so this was kind of like a a company thing so we went to singapore for a few days and that was really interesting um you know of course eh it's a lot different over there um not just like going to canada or something but they had a big reception the evening we got there and they had like a play put on by the principals of the company which was real fun and um after singapore uh we did some tours in singapore it was really it was a interesting experience it's really clean there and it's really there's not a lotta crime but the government is very it it's a little bit imposing but it was very interesting then we went to thailand and that was almost <almo> it was really completely different 'cause it's like jungle we went to um phuket it's a little island and it was just it was very primitive compared to singapore just in a lotta different ways but it was very interesting and it was nice and everything was really cheap had a massage on the beach for eight dollars <laughter> it was interesting yeah yeah it was an hour for eight dollars <laughter> mm well i'm in school right now and um i didn't i didn't finish school when i was younger because i had um i had health problems so um here i am i'm i'm just doing my general ed right now i'm going to s_m_c yeah i'm happy ooh <sigh> well my dream job would be <sigh> to be a veterinarian but uh it's probably not very realistic for me at this stage in life and you know also because of monetarily it costs a lot but that would be my dream job working with animals and and in in a veterinary capacity yeah i think i'm right on the cusp um it depends on the environment and the people i'm with and how comfortable i am but um i'm really outgoing when i feel comfortable with people and i'll be really reserved <laughter> if i'm not yeah <laughter> <laughter> uh <sigh> well i mean aside from sleeping um i like like relaxing things uh like going for a bike ride on the strand or um if i'm at home uh just like reading or a lotta times i can just lay there and my mind might be doing things but i'm kinda relaxing ah really good i don't have i would say there's certain things that um they can really like make me like when i see injustices or things like that then i mean i can really feel it but i never just like fly off the handle or throw things or uh even you know yell <laughter> <sigh> argued um <sigh> i can't really say i have arguments i mean just like a disagreement or an actual argument like if we just well uh i would say last summer when um i think it was after a baseball game there was a group of us and we went uh to we went to have shabu shabu after the game and i don't know i think scrubbed_entry and i don't know it's it's it's kind of a tenuous friendship like mm she's a good friend in some ways and she's mm we're we're actually kinda distant in other ways so i i don't consider her um like someone that i would confide in and you know if any deep problems but um sometimes we just have she's very touchy and she doesn't have the same sense of humor i do so i think she had said some things to me during the night which mm kinda bothered me but mm you know i just kinda that's just how she is and then i guess i said some things that she felt were eh well she gets really offended easily i think <laughter> but um after that we didn't talk for a while but then we then one day she called me up and then we were friends again but like she never she never confronted me hardest decision <sigh> uh it was leaving my ex-boyfriend uh well it wasn't <sigh> it was a long time coming i mean i was thinking about it for like five years um you know he wasn't like beating me or anything he was a really good guy but we just had a lot of um we <w> we weren't always on the same wavelength and we did have a lot of like disagreements so i had thought about it and thought about it and we were already engaged but we had been together for a long time so i don't know uh i was always it was always on my mind like should i get married or should i not and then finally eh we were just always having um we were always what what's the word i'm looking for um we were just having these little snippy disagreements all the time and then one day we had one and i just decided that i was gonna leave and um i did it was really hard it was it was the hardest decision in my life and i can stay that definitively um and but i i think it was for the best <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um probably leaving my job for well to help my friend start a business in nevada and when i when i i really liked my job i mean it was it was pretty good um it was right over at the beach and when i told them that i was leaving then they offered me this huge raise and they offered me a a different position which was awesome and that was really stressful for me because um i'd already promised my friend <laughter> to leave i wouldn't have gotten the position you know offer if if it wasn't for her wanting me to come over there um it was really really stressful and i stressed over it for about three weeks until i actually left and um when i went over there like we had we had made agreements about how much they were gonna pay me and blah blah blah when i got there everything like she didn't remember telling me that i needed a certain amount and the other principals of the company were um you know the <th> it was a hard situation 'cause she had she had talked with me but they hadn't talked with me and they're like well that's too much and also they were a different religion and it was very strange i mean they were all one religion <laughter> i was i was surrounded by mormons and i i don't have anything against mormons but it was very different because eh eh i was kind of an outsider there and then also the weather was just it was absolutely awful there <laughter> so i would say that's one decision it it's it just a a pivotal point in my life and i think that um i really wish i i had just stayed <laughter> um well if you're gonna erase something from my memory then <laughter> um i would probably say <sigh> my memory like really if if i could erase something from my memory what would i want to erase is that what you're saying mm <sigh> can't really think of anything i mean even like that that bad decision that i made you know it it has value in it so <sigh> i can't really say that i would want something erased i mean maybe if i was like raped or something and it was really <sigh> horrifying then i would but i don't <sigh> well if you're talking about sleep <s> being in a deep sleep i'm in a deep sleep a lot but i never feel rested and that's um it's a medical problem of mine well i always feel like i haven't slept for two days and um there are points in in the day i would say in some <s> during some days there are points in the day where i really feel alert and alive and and rested but they're short-lived but i sleep a lot i sleep uh pretty crappy <laughter> physically pretty crappy yeah well thanks <laughter> no <sniffle> i haven't been officially diagnosed with depression but um that's that's usually what doctors um like my sleeping problem hasn't been diagnosed i'm i'm in the process of really working to get it diagnosed but um that's the first thing that they try and figure out they they've given me like depression drugs before but they haven't helped with my sleep but i do <sigh> i do <sigh> i would say i feel down sometimes <someti> well my life is very strange right now so there are a lot of reasons to feel down um i would say that i do feel down sometimes a lotta times but it's not i would say it's reasonable considering the situations that i'm in uh they're just triggered by the fact that my health is is not great and it makes it makes life really difficult but um i wouldn't say it's triggered by anything in particular oh there i mean <sigh> you mean for a long period of time or i mean i i experience happiness like when i go out with friends or i go and you know i've find some great new dish i like i mean what type of happiness are you looking for um <sigh> well i mean right now um my friend just had surgery and so i'm staying with her this week um i'm really enjoying it i mean even though we could never live together i could never live with live with her long term and i'm sure she couldn't live with me long term but i'm having fun and um you know she just she i i installed the groupon app on her ah on her phone um yesterday 'cause she's been paying too much for laser hair removal <laughter> and so i installed it on her phone and then today she's she's looking up cupcakes so she had me pick up cupcakes on the way here to bring back to her uh as a groupon deal so i mean you know there's little fun things like that <sniffle> uh <sigh> probably um o_c_d <laughter> and um she probably thinks i'm pretty prissy compared to her um i think that she would say that i have a good heart um we're very different um and probably that i'm <sigh> i should ask her <laughter> uh i don't know we we go out so i think she'd say that i'm fun um but she has mentioned that i'm i'm a very private person and that i know i i knew before she said that why um <sigh> i have <ha> well i told you i have i have a lotta problems right now and <sigh> so i don't really tell people about them um it it's kind of a it's kind of a killjoy but also people can feel i feel that people can feel less comfortable if they perceive that you have a have difficulties and they feel kind of um it just uncomfortable like oh they maybe they should help or they feel guilty but they have good busy lives so just kinda creates a gap but i would say even before even before this difficult time in my life i've been i've been a private person i don't know why i think <thi> i think a lot eh you know i'm a deep thinker and maybe it's just you know not like i feels like i feel abnormal but um maybe i just have a lotta thoughts that don't seem doesn't seem appropriate to share with people or i'm not sure <sniffle> ten or twenty years ago <sigh> um well one thing that i regret right now is um you know i haven't really found somebody you know to spend the rest of my life with so i would tell myself to concentrate more on that 'cause once you hit forty it's really <rea> it's it's a lot harder that's it um i would say <sigh> that i've perservered i'm very proud that even though i have a lot of difficulties in my life the fact that i'm you know making this commitment to go to school and i'm doing it on my own and um you know it's it's kind of a if people if people knew all the problems that i have they'd be like well you know why are you worrying about school but um i really feel that you know i'm i'm doing this and and i'm really proud that even through everything um yeah i'm getting a's thanks mm k thanks bye 
<synch> yes i'm doing fine uh mexico uh when i was young seven years old i've been there like uh three or four times for vacation well it's uh less stressful i don't know if it's because i'm on vacation but i feel more at peace over there than here well my uh family moved down here for a better life uh that was my parents mm just the weather and the different things that you could do you could be at the beach or you could go to the mountains different variety of things to do the traffic and sometimes <somet> yeah basically the traffic and yeah that's one of the main things not that much i been to new york and uh mexico only uh just uh seeing new places and finding new locations you know something new like for a trip or well i've been to uh in mexico i've been to the pyramids of uh i forgot what's it called in mexico city and i like you know about uh finding about my ancient culture since i'm uh uh mexican from mayan aztec so i like to see different things like that well uh at school well i did uh drop out but i came back and i'm trying to get back into it right now trying to learn uh graphic designs well i started liking you know to take pictures doing different things and i like you know uh going into business i like what the it entitles about i wanna have my own business either making web pages just be able to be free and don't being relying on someone else just be able to have freedom for myself outgoing well i just like to you know be around people like to get to know people and depending on the person how i feel around 'em i like to hear music or you know do do different things like play sports or do different things just to unwind well i'm getting better at it you know i xxx well it was like uh two days ago it was something about uh i needed to pay a bill or something <some> something that uh i you know i had taken care of but the person he's like more picky about it you know he's more you know how how girls are you know they they want everything right there and then i have it handled you know i have it everything there and they just bugging sometimes they don't give you the space that you need to resolve something well i felt like i was overwhelmed i already had it resolved i just was waiting for a check you know that's not on my control but i already had made the paper proper arrangements and she's bugging me about it and it's like you're making you know an argument you know a storm in a glass of water it's like mhm well uh differently there's couple of them but not so recently because i've been more trying to get my life together but the decisions i made before in the past like dropping out of school and doing other different things mm guilty not that much because not really not that i could think right off the top of my head the hardest decision oh it's just not on top of my head right now an event mm well the only things that i remember is when i black out or different things like that that i don't remember but not nothing like a particular only when my uh brothers died and different things like that mhm well my brother was in gangs and different things and he was getting more into trouble and it's just not a pleasant memory for me to talk about that much get into it no i'm hispanic i you know i like to be with my family and you know i i like to go over there to mexico too i have a half-sister and my grandpa died he was over there in mexico so i do uh like to have a good relationship with my family well my mom and dad they always work hard they always done what they had to do to pay the bills that's why sometimes i be like you know running around trying to get everythings done but done correctly not trying to take the easy way out it's a little hard because there eh especially here in los angeles there's a lotta different things that you could get into that's not that positive and it's hard to stay focused on you know the correct stuff well normally i just knock out it's not that hard it's like it takes me like half an hour or fifteen minutes but uh sometimes i can't even wake up even with the alarm uh they have to wake me up you know my girl has to wake me up even with the alarm going on it's like so hard so you know i just knock out i do get a little either i'm angry or i don't feel good and i'm not filled with energy but i still have to know i know i have to do something so i still go through with it i been well i been uh feeling good you know been a little restless but not that much i had to do stuff so i just you know put myself to do it no matter how i feel no nothing out of the ordinary no no the last time i felt happy that was probably on the weekend that i was you know going out with a going out have some fun and you know i was drinking and just relaxing and winding <win> winding down mhm my ideal weekend is usually with my girl either out or at home just relax but nothing else you know just be able to relax and unwind with her you know either going out somewhere to a nice place or staying at home but without getting any calls or xxx interruptions you know just be able to turn off the phone and turn off everything just be with her doing the other different things mhm uh like an outgoing guy you know very social but at the same time i'm reserved depending how i feel with people have to you know build trust or feel comfortable with them oh i'm changing a lot you know like uh my temper and different things drinking things i'm changing a little different things so i could get more different things done oh there's several but mostly uh is when i'm coming from mexico that they wanna demeander you even down there it feels uh like silly because i went to a store i was regularly dressed and i was telling 'em i wanted to buy something and then they said that that i i wasn't belong there and i and as soon as they saw my credit card they kinda changed perspective because they saw the wells fargo logo they know i was american but they thought it was like you know it it was <wa> it felt me it felt ridiculous to me because you go to a place and you have the money you ask for something you're gonna ask for something because you have it not just to waste <wa> kill their time just because they saw a logo of a card that's how they you know it just it was ridiculous for me no basically uh to stay more focused on different things uh stay in school and you know don't go you know try to control my temper and do different things because if i knew what i know now back then it'd be different well uh i did drop out but i did uh go back to school and i you know i did get my high school and right now i'm in the process of doing other different things so right now is uh getting my high school getting that together and right now i'm working to another goal trying to get you know my either going back to school so it's basically <ba> basically getting back to school and finishing the high school the g_e_d mhm okay you're welcome

internet and i like to do sweepstakes i'm a a person that loves to try to enter in a lot of contests and i've been very successful since i was a kid i've won a lot of sweepstakes and uh in the evening time uh i find like a hour of time and i just go online and just eh i'm so good at it i know just about exactly the right time to even enter 'em i usually try to enter 'em before midnight when everybody else is sleep so it's been successful for me um getting married and having my children <laughter> mm i have a twenty-seven-year-old son and i have a thirty-one-year-old son um both of 'em uh well one of 'em's married the other one's not and i just not too long ago became a grandmother so i have one grandson and uh my uh son he uh works for the county of los angeles as a conveyance <co> a property conveyance conveyance examiner and the other one is a computer engineer so and i've been married for thirty three years and um basically uh marriage pretty strong you know what if you build a foundation with your children and have a good relationship with them and talk to 'em and find out what's going on and tell 'em that you love them uh my son i've taught them all the time when they went out the door i love you and even today when they'll call me and hang up they say mom i love you you always have to give them that that um good feeling when they leave the door that you care and uh i i've never had to go to <t> to <t> eh to any jail to get 'em out um they've been pretty obedient i mean boys will be boys but um i never had any problem as far as uh them getting into any serious trouble and i'm very proud of that especially with boys i don't know how it would've been with a girls maybe a little different but <laughter> with boys i have to say they were pretty obedient and they respect the law uh the best thing is watching them grow and become parents themselves and see what they learn basically from you and um i've watched my son like i said i just a recent grandmother and i watch him how he handles his son and it's it seems like he's learned a lot from his foundation that he learned at home on how to handle his son to be responsible to go to work every day and he knows that hey i got a wife i have a son and it's my job to make sure that i keep a roof over their heads so it pays off and i i basically he treats her well um my mother was more stricter on me <laughter> uh my my my parents um for some unknown reason i i guess because i my sister and i we're the girls they they weren't strict on the boys but they were more strict on the girls so they didn't let us go to a lot of places and then my parents also they weren't type that liked to travel and i used to look at them and say no i'm not gonna be like them i'm gonna travel i'm not gonna just stay home i i mean i mean <me> there's nothing wrong with 'em because they found love at home <laughter> and did things at home but they never really traveled anywhere and my mom used she was afraid of planes for one and i used to try to talk her into get on a plane and go somewhere and she said oh i'm gonna go here i'm going to go there but she never did she died she never did do <d> do any travel so i've made up for her and uh i i want to do something different and that's to to travel more than and be more out there i was more of a social butterfly my mother was a not a social butterfly so i made up for it i think before i speak and then i am the type of person also to um i take on other people's feelings before i um blurt out the wrong thing i try to uh analyze the situation first before <bef> because sometimes you can put your <yo> open your mouth too soon and you can put yourself in something that you may not be able to get out of um <laughter> it's probably something about my husband did <laughter> oh he <h> i know what it was it's about uh well probably over some construction <cons> new construction that my husband is working on on our house uh we had a disagreement on that um men have their own way of doing things and um i had told him not to use a certain uh eh person to work on our house but because of the personal relationship he has with this person he went on ahead and now he sees all the downfalls and he didn't listen and so i didn't say i told you so but i guess he can tell by my facial expression that uh he he'd have done wrong and i told him i said look you're losing money and it became one problem after another so now all the construction thing is up in the air right now 'cause he knows he has done wrong and uh but he doesn't wanna face the fact that well he knows it but he doesn't wanna really face the fact so he says look it's my project no it's our project so uh eh that that's one of the biggest arguments what we're having right now um that i can think of that's recent i felt that he <h> he <h> he didn't really listen to me and he more so looked at uh a cheaper economical way that he can get this done without going through the proper ways 'cause i told him that um you need to do your research i'm the type of person i do my research before i jump into something i i i try to dot my i's and cross my t's but my husband he's not like that he's like oh i can get this person can do this project for x amount of money and he's a good friend of mine so i don't care i mean is he licensed he doesn't look at all that stuff he's he just jumps into it <laughter> which cost him some extra money unnecessary money that he spent when and then i mean it was a lot of money and so i was really very upset yesterday and i was very upset about it because it was just wasted money that we could've saved 'cause we wind up doing the same thing all over again and it didn't make any sense um i retired early um i was very fortunate to retire at age fifty i retired in two thousand and two i was working for the state of california um as a disability analyst and what happened was i was able the reason why i was able to retire so early because i'd been working since i was eighteen and i had like thirty one and a half years of service and what was so nice about it that only needed <n> needed to vest in like ten years in my health insurance so i was able to get full health insurance but the only thing about it when you retire i was with calpirg and i don't know if you're familiar with calpirg but um we we have a excellent retirement system and since i had been working with them so long um i didn't get the full percentage i should've stayed 'til i was fifty five but i got out at fifty and i didn't get the full amount but that's okay um eh i i found myself going back doing a little part-time job because of the economical reason and then i have wantitis <laughter> so um i think that was the kind of mistake i did i should've kinda waited 'til i was fifty five than fifty but i look at it now as far as the health insurance i really benefited because of the rising cost of the health insurance have went up and i don't i pay very little money so i think that over uh negates the uh uh uh the money that i receive um let me see the hardest it's probably when my mom died 'cause uh i'm not used to anybody dying and my mother um died in ninety nine of uh non-hodgkin lymphoma and i i xxx putting her funeral together um my brother and sister we never we would never face anybody dying or putting a funeral together and all the responsibility <responsi> because i am the eldest it was put in me and i'm like oh my god what do i do xxx and so um i was kinda like left out there trying to find her insurance policy 'cause i had asked her to make sure she put everything in order and she never got to it so the hardest thing was going through her house and trying to get all the stuff together and finding things you know i myself i keep my things organized but um for some unknown reason she didn't have hers organized and i think that was the hardest and knowing how much i had to pay 'cause i had to come out of pocket on some of my stuff and unfortunately my mom <laughter> this is interesting she had one little small barrel insurance but she had million dollar of accident insurance and she didn't die of course with with accident she had a medical condition so that was something so we had to pay for the whole just about everything yeah it was it was but and now i can handle i i i um <laughter> this will sound weird but um since that i've learned from that so i have made it available for my children that my husband and i we got together and we wind up getting our insurance uh uh uh uh policy xxx not insurance policy but um what do you call the um barrel insurance we had that and it just we've had it for mm many many years so it's almost paid but xxx ten years it'll pay for everything um the plot and everything and uh another thing that i did i've even written my own obituary i know that sounds weird so my son make one phone call that's it i don't want them to go through what i went through and my husband agreed that's the one thing we did agree on and um he said he don't want anybody to to have any problem uh people coming in and telling 'em what to do it's already written we did a living trust i mean it's nothing they can do but make one phone call and that's it i have no problem sleeping i sleep very <laughter> well pretty good um i've been a little tired but that's only because of physical condition um i have i found i have vitamin b deficiency and vitamin d xxx deficiency so it's more physical but not in the mental um exercise walk walking more so no not really no no i'm basically happily all the time i'm mm more so i'm making other people happy i get more phone calls of people want inspiration about things uh uh when they have projects they working on and i try to encourage them uh and it makes me feel good when they hang up and say you know hey i really appreciate your input um thanks and then they i'll i'll follow up on 'em and see how they're doing oh uh resource person i've been um described as a resource person from my supervisor to from my friends because i'm the type of person i research everything i get into just about i just don't  xxx dive into any situation i try to look up information uh some i know we have the technology here uh that you can get everything on the internet but also go back to the old school like like even finding this place i mean i did the map google but also i love the thomas brother i'm never gonna give up my thomas brothers map yellow pages you'd be surprised i don't give up my yellow pages so there's certain little things that i don't really let go i know we have technology but sometimes you know you'd be surprised that you can go around and find a whole lot of stuff that even though technology gives <gi> you have it right at your finger but you can find things and and they say i'm more of a resource person and most people come to me just to to look up things and i get that that that spunk about it because i like to look for stuff and find it and that gives me satisfaction uh i wish i can uh um stop going up and down on my weight <laughter> i'll lose weight i'll go on this big diet before the summertime and and then by christmas time i'm i have a what they call a yo-yo weight problem and if i can stop binging and making food my friend um i think that's just a nervous disorder i just <ju> i like to eat and um but also i don't like to be overweight either 'cause i have plenty of beautiful clothes at home and i can't get 'em xxx on right now so i know i say if i'm gonna go on this binge and try to lose weight for the summertime so i can get into those some nice clothes so it's mm mostly uh not happy with my weight that's it yeah i'm sorry didn't hear you um no not really i regret <laughter> that i can't stay skinny <laughter> i can't lose i mean i can lose the weight but i i regret not being able to keep it i i fall back on putting the weight back on um let's see xxx ten or twenty years ago mm i would've saved a little bit more money before i retired <laughter> and uh xxx uh basically um putting away more money before i retire instead of retiring too early most proudest is of my life um meeting a lot of people that came in my life uh i got good friends i still have fifteen of the best friends that i went to elementary school and in very rare you could find anybody can walk around and say they have the same fifteen group of friends we were in a sorority together went to college together lived in the same neighborhood and matter of fact we just had um well all of us had our sixty year birthday and our our high school group we put together a sixty year birthday reunion and here all fifteen of us with exception of one we're all alive and healthy and we keep in contact so i think uh it's basically keeping the same friends i think eh we're gonna probably outlive each other <laughter> okay you're welcome bye bye 
<sync> yes i'm okay thank you um i was born in east los angeles and yes um the freedom to explore outdoors and with different um weather temperature <temp> you know with weather <clears throat> temperature and climates to go skiing or to the beach maybe in the same day i like that um mm i think probably the overcrowding um and the smog mm not not frequently but i have meeting other people and learning about their environment and their cultures sure um the last trip i've taken outside of here was to italy and um that was my second time being there and i enjoyed it more this time because um i knew what i wanted to see when i came back and um and i was better prepared for italians and their culture i felt i wasn't as uh you know i was just better prepared i thought for that trip um <clears throat> that would be um being in the countryside and seeing a very tiny house in the midst of acres and acres and acres of grapes was just magnificent um human development um <clears throat> i actually didn't decide at first to do that i started school with the intent of being a lactation consultant and um i went to a program in which you could get a degree as well as get your license to become a lactation consultant and through the process i learned that um i had to do a long internship without pay and at the time <t> and i miss i had a family so i had to make a different <diff> a career choice quickly and um so the college offered human development as a major and i um just went right in and used my used <u> used my units that i had already acquired towards that particular major and and i'm happy with it um currently no i stay at home i have a little one uh well he's not so little i'm preparing to go back to work um in the meantime i design jewelry well i have three children um i have a almost four year old and then i have two older children seventeen and twenty three no um that your children the the love <sigh> from them and for them is unconditional all the stages that they go through they're stages all the time for every age <laughter> and then everybody in my household is all different because they're different ages so um i think i'm probably more in tune with those different stages that's why it makes me crazy um and i think that my parents the time that my parents were parents it was just kinda like you know is she fed is she dressed she has a house i mean a roof over her head and we're doing great as parents and we love her and so it wasn't um there wasn't too much i felt that that parents thought about in terms of that in terms of parenting in that way and like today you know there's books for every age every year month you know <clears throat> and um so i think it difference differs in that way tremendously very close <clears throat> outgoing mm i don't i don't um feel uninhibited <u> uninhibited i feel a little you know confident to talk to people i probably talk more than i need to <laughter> um <clears throat> i bead i <clears throat> do i design jewelry that's what i do to relax i'm pretty good i i well i think i um try not to not to um feel or let others know what my emotions are when i'm upset um which is not good 'cause if i don't do anything with them then i know that at some point it's gonna come out and um yeah that that's uh something i have to work on like exercising or something um <clears throat> it was my husband and it was about um he asked me whether i thought about cheating ever in our marriage on him uh really tired of talking about that same topic um well it came it spawned from <f> from a client of my husband's who's a female and she shared with him that she'd been cheating on her husband for like a year because she resented him for many things and um <clears throat> and so he took that information and came home and decided to ask me if i ever thought about it and what made me think about cheating and he knows that i've been resentful of him and did that make me feel like it did that make me want to cheat or did i think about cheating <clears throat> and um <sigh> i we've had this conversation a lot of times and uh i mean not just that but i don't know just about cheating in general and um so i just said what i normally said normally say is that i haven't um cheated and that i did think about that when we were first together and uh but it was just a mere thought and um and then his response was i know that if we cheated on each other we would never tell one another and that just kinda <sigh> i guess irritated me i was really bothered by that and i just started thinking you know we're having this conversation yet again and why are we having this conversation <laughter> are you the one that's cheating and so that's how that that went into that um argument i mean it wasn't ayelling <y> yelling i mean it was part conversation and part texting um <sigh> not talking at all <laughter> um <sigh> mm pretty much any situation that involves my children and if i've yelled because i really don't like if i came to the point where i've had more of yelled it bothers me because um i was yelled at a lot and i just feel bad about that and i try really hard to not handle any kind of situation that involves my children no matter how upset i might get and result in in yelling hmm that would probably be whether to keep a pregnancy or not yeah yeah i um i was just talking about it yesterday actually and um oh i was pregnant and i had wanted i wasn't married yet and i had wanted to be married and but i just didn't think that i it was the right time for me and um i had pretty much made up my mind that i was not going to keep that pregnancy but i made the decision by myself and when my partner found uh discovered that i was pregnant he said that he very much wanted to have a child and wanted to marry me and so that decision was quite hard because i felt obligated to do so and felt super guilty to not and <drops microphone> oops and uh this is on correctly um hang on this ear piece is falling there we go that was probably the hardest decision actually you know what no i wouldn't say that's the hardest decision i ever had to make i'm sorry the hardest decision that i had to make in my life was whether or not <clears throat> um the hospital should um unplug the life or um life support machine for my father or not that was the hardest decision um because i knew that the quality of life he wanted for himself was more than that and to have been um to resort to the situation that he was in not capable of doing anything at all either speaking for himself um was beyond it who he was and i just couldn't see him like that anymore and he would be a vegetable i was told so i agreed to um resort that not hardly ever <laughter> too many things running on my mind um and pretty much um mostly on the weekends because my older kids are out and about with their friends uh even though i know that they're gonna come <co> i mean i'm constantly worried about uh how they are when they come home and so i really can't fall asleep on the weekends most of the time but um and you <y> sometimes it's just been so many days of not getting a good night's sleep i'm just exhausted <ex> exhausted i pass out but it's hard very stressed mm my son is is um has been uh in dealing with some legal issues and um currently is incarcerated and uh it's been really hard yes i've been probably very short moody irritable well i often think about a lot of things that aren't even happening <laughter> my mind just goes from one point a to point b and i don't even know how i got there um you know it's interesting uh yeah no yes about three years ago um my um o_b_g suggested i i uh see a psychiatrist yes well um i've in the process of changing therapists so it's been about because the program that i was in um lost funding and i lost my therapist or the therapist that i was working with and so it's been about two months maybe three now and um but i did notice when i was in therapy um that it was just an intricate part of my my life my week to see my therapist um it really helped me cope um <sigh> when i picked up my son <laughter> up from um when he was released from um jail um a go getter uh probably you know uh she would use the term hustler but meaning that i'll i'm not afraid to do a lot of different kinds of jobs to do what i need to do to support my family i mean you know legally of course um outgoing um maybe sometimes a little too for too outgoing for her um and compassionate sensitive loyal mm all the things that remind me of my mother <laughter> well yelling the yelling part was one um just <j> just the little things that used to drive me so crazy i see <s> can see myself doing them and it bothers me a lot regarding what mm <clears throat> um not too much really i don't know <clears throat> to go to college right after high school and not wait um and <sigh> that i didn't really need to be in a relationship to be happy or that you don't have to be in a relationship to be happy that you can certainly be successful and not in a relationship and still be happy and live life um what did i do mm i visited my son yesterday and that was really good yeah i was happy that he was safe um my children and uh my accomplishments in um school and work bye 
<sync> yes okay other than this laryngitis i have uh cleveland ohio in uh seventy nine i think it was <laughter> mhm um once a year something like that or less um uh there's a lot more to do here um they're a little more narrow minded back there and republican <laughter> um well originally show business but probably to get away from uh cleveland it was very difficult at first um i'm not used to uh change i don't like change very much you know having to uh meet new people and figure out how to make a living well i like the um different opportunities you have the different the health consciousness the movies um the variety of things you can do the places you can go the weather um the driving the congestion some of the superficial attitude the importance mhm um well not a lot but i do i just came back from vegas to visit relatives we met there and i'm going to mexico um next month um well seeing the different cultures like been to europe greece france <p> um italy um i like going to places such as mexico where it's gonna be sunny and just lying out i went to last year i went to arizona i never saw sedona that was really uh an experience pure peaceful about sedona yeah well sedona's a very energetic place and um i thought it was desert like flat kind of desert looking but it was it's very rocky and when you land in flagstaff there's these beautiful uh pine trees and it's the elevation is high and and coming into sedona was very beautiful and and after a day the pain in my back went away that i had there for months so and you had this even though we went to bed late and got up early you had this energy so it was really um very mystical in life <laughter> or in sedona in life um well being on stage in boston and um that was great i i loved doing that um um just being with friends and laughing are some of my highest moments when we're laughing hysterically well um i don't know of a particular situation but when i when i decorate for special events and um i worked with somebody on a regular basis and we would just find humor in everything and just laugh and and i i can't think of particular situation or what we were laughing at but just being with somebody who's in tune with my sense of humor and uh gets my jokes and you know i get his and we're just um enjoying that moment um speech and drama i i majored in uh no not now i always was interested in um musical comedy when i was a child i would sing along to records in my living room and i was always in choirs in school and then when i uh went to high school i joined the drama club and i i just always had an interest and i always had a a big personality and well <laughter> um i don't know if i have a dream job anymore i'm sixty and i don't know if i have aspirations anymore towards towards doing anything right now i'd just rather not work <laughter> and just um relax and travel but um i i like being creative in in any way i can i like independence and i kind of have that right now so i'm okay um well i i watch my favorite television shows that i've recorded and i also am a buddhist i've been a buddhist for um gosh since nineteen eighty eight and um i'm a district leader in my community and we have meetings and that really helps to center me and bring out my higher self so if i get tense or nervous i i chant um sometimes okay sometimes not a lot yes yes <laughter> less and less though it's been happening less and less but um yeah sometimes it's got it's it's um created difficulties well i can't <c> <sigh> i can't remember an argument i remember getting angry like was just when i was on my trip in vegas i was driving and the g_p_s said stay in the left lane and i stayed in the left lane but when i got off the freeway it brought me onto the ramp that went back onto the freeway about four miles out of our way and i just i got very angry for about thirty seconds and then i had to calm myself down and say okay alright so we're gonna be late you know i had to talk myself out of it so it wasn't really an argument with anybody but i felt kind of bad that i overreacted um you mean in my life <laughter> manys yes um gosh there's so many <laughter> i i just wish that when somebody tells me disappointing information like they're not gonna use me on a job or something that i would take an attitude that um i'll find something better it's okay and move on as opposed to feeling what's wrong with me and you know did i do something wrong and then get angry at them and you know that whole uh thought process that really doesn't help the situation and i do that more often but i since i started chanting but it doesn't you know i'm not always in my high life condition <laughter> where i can do that um i find a lot of situations <laughter> hard to make like you know what television to buy or something <laughter> but um um i guess <gue> i guess the hardest decision would be one that had the biggest consequences and um um or leaving my  comfort zone <z> place if the decision meant that i have to leave my comfort place that would be a very difficult decision for me and probably leaving a relationship very hard because you <y> you know i get dependent on that relationship so i usually live it out til it's for you know it's they leave or something you know it's very hard for me to make that decision that this isn't right and i have to move on so what i usually do is i don't make the decision and i end up suffering but longer so mhm can we move on um well uh it's hard because um i don't know if it's because i have pain in my back and neck but i i it's difficult for me to stay asleep i'd i i i don't get a um a deep sleep um but at because of uh well i so okay it's hard to say because right now i i have this cold and i've had it for two weeks so i've been taking nyquil and that's been putting me to sleep so i have been um sleeping better because of it but last night i i woke up coughing so it's it's hard to tell but before that all happened i was um finding it difficult to stay asleep and so therefore i'm tired during the day and uh sometimes i'm groggy sometimes i'm irritable but yeah i'm not really sure if it's related to this pain in my back or emotional things or or or or not i'm sorry could you repeat that have i studied changes in my behavior uh no <laughter> i was not no mm mm oh i was happy last week <laughter> you know well i uh was going to um vegas to meet my family was my my family was flying in from cleveland to uh there we have a a relative in uh vegas and i drove with my friend and it was my brother in law's seventieth birthday so we all went and had a good time in vegas i mean i was struggling through my cold but but it was fun it was nice well <laughter> uh they think i'm funny um they feel that i say it like it is um they understand <under> they all say they understand me <laughter> so people who don't understand me i think sometimes don't know how to take me 'cause i'll i'll say something sometimes come out come across sarcastic but just <ju> that's just the way i talk so um my um the anger that sometimes wells up in me you know i just but although that that really made me i think a lot of the person that i am you know all all of your experiences make you who you are and how you handle them makes you who you are and if you don't have those lows you don't really know what highs are so i don't i can't really go back and regret you know i wish certain things didn't happen whatever but really what matters is today and now and how you handle today and i wish that well i can i don't wish i know that i will have less of these moments where i've just blurt out you know anger or something i just wish that would happen more less that the anger parts would happen less and they are so i guess it will <laughter> happen less um don't give up hope live in the moment and um everything will everything will work out everything will work out and if you believe that then you really have nothing to fear um the fact that now and for the past twenty years twenty some years i've been cultivating myself and i've become <be> i've become more um compassionate person and i'm able to um uh <ss> understand people better and see that you know their suffering <ss> they're suffering too and that if you if you treat people from that respect that they're they have their problems too and they're suffering with their problems too you're able to live a better life because you're not allowing that to affect you you're not taking it personally and at the same time you're becoming more compassionate person and when you're more compassionate you're you're happy and your life is happy okay 
<synch> <clears throat> yes i'm doing fine thank you i'm from los angeles california yes um well the main thing i like the weather um i like the lifestyle i like um the variety of beach um snow we have it all um some things i don't like about l_a um the rent is way way way way too expensive it's ridiculous um i have i'm well-traveled um i enjoy seeing new places going new places um it's different everywhere the people are different um it's fun um okay well the most recent is last year i went to family reunion in new orleans so that was in june and um while i was there we also visited slidell louisiana for the um the swamp tours and vicksburg mississippi where my mom is from and we spent the night in ferriday lousiana with my aunt who will be a hundred and one this year in may um there's a lot um as far as traveling or just period uh most memorable experience um well i don't know if it's just one um probably when i used to travel with my dad that's where i got a lot of my traveling from um yeah it was bus car sometimes planes uh mostly what just i guess i'll say mostly down south but it was really fun especially the road trips mhm um just general and also drama uh well my dream job is to become a real estate investor um well i've sort of really been into it ever since two thousand five um i just don't have the capital right now or the connections that um since i do like real estate i'm just going to start off as a real estate agent so i should have my license um sometime this year outgoing um well i'm not shy um it could be a little bit of both but um i'm pretty outgoing um well speaking of hawaii i did uh live there for a year and a half but what do i do to relax is either um usually take a nap <laughter> um take a bath um or just try to get things off of my mind and try to spend my energy in more positive ways um it needs to be worked on but um i know when to control it um when i need to um well me and my ex-husband still get into arguments um it was just over a text message but um actually it was my fault but um usually it's his but it just starts little and kind of snowballs out of control but um that's usually how it goes <laughter> um well i xxx don't know what else to do except for pray on it because i thought once i moved into another house it would be over but i see that we're still getting into it so um i don't know maybe ignore it or if he wants to be right then let him be right i guess um probably quite a few things but i don't regret anything i've done in my life but um situation i wish i would've handled differently um just kind of everything in my life almost <laughter> i could've done it differently or i would if i had the chance but i'm not worried about it 'cause i don't regret anything that i've done in my life the hardest decision um probably when i had to get a divorce that mm that may have been the hardest or one of the hardest decisions um it was just a lot of um a lot of stuff through the years um <clears throat> the relationship had kind of deteriorated um if the relationship between us was still good then the things that he were doing um i would have been able to overlook it a little bit more because um i've i would feel like well our relationship is good and it's difficult to find a really really good relationship but since our relationship deteriorated and there's just a lot of disagreement and arguing and problems financial problems and he's doing this so um i just decided just forget it i mean i tried but eh you know he didn't wanna cooperate so um well i'm happy with what's going on now i mean i wish that we could still be a family but since that's not going to happen yes i am happy with my life right now yes um something i can erase um mm i don't think i really need to erase anything um i've finally gotten over the way the kids treated me at school but other than that i can't think of anything to erase um it's fair slash good um there's no problems right now so i guess i'll just say good yeah there's no problems um well i would have to say my mother yes um well she's just always supported me and everything that i've done um whether it's good or not so good so um i think that's a blessing mhm um sometimes sometime it's not um well i just don't get enough hours of sleep i guess that's what it is as i would like to um sometimes so um that's more the problem i would like to get mhm um just sleepy <sigh> yeah sleepy tired feeling like i wanna go take a nap um i've been feeling fine mhm uh no they've been about the same no no um really happy uh probably last week because i got over to a little bit of money so <laughter> um well i guess my best friend would be my mom or maybe my um entertainment friend that i've been knowing since ninety six i really wouldn't i'm not gonna say i don't consider him a best friend but we don't really hang out that much but he is very um generous to me and my mom mhm so um well right now i spend my weekends doing chores and classwork and sleeping in but maybe after the classwork is out of the way um <laughter> maybe i can do something else uh myself well i do wish that um at times i could control my temper a little more and um of course i would like to lose weight um be a little bit more active and um i wish my skin would clear up um it was probably when i was in school um school years are terrible for a lot of people because the kids are animals so um they try to make you feel like um you're nothing like you're piece of dirt under their foot so that's probably the last time as an adult no um i would say that i'm genuine um i'm honest um i'm supportive and um i'm just a good friend no um well uh twenty years ago um just because you're pregnant that doesn't mean that you're eating for two and you can eat loads of food like um people tell you <laughter> um that's the main thing um i'm going to tell my daughters no um just eat as you normally eat but eat more healthier um there's no need to gain eighty pounds when the baby is just twenty pounds or less and you have all this weight to lose um also if i came into any money now twenty years ago i was probably just thinking about shopping or um just kind of spending it on frivolous stuff whereas now i would um invest it um so yeah i think that's about it <laughter> um proud of uh <sigh> mm i guess maybe myself um my kids k thank you bye 
<synch> sure i'm well thank you southern california the weather <sigh> the uh mountains the ocean mm traffic air quality no not a lot mm time money i studied art <sigh> studio art it was just always a a talent and a desire i had from childhood i am mm making a good living through my art it's challenging well i need <nee> it's about having the time and finding a niche that appeals to others while being able to do work that stays true to my own vision somewhere in between i read i walk dogs i spend time with my family oh it's very good i i love my family very much and they love me very much we're very supportive of each other i'm pretty good most of the time i'm not so great when i'm dealing with a lot of rush hour traffic but it's not out of control <laughter> hmm i don't really remember i wanna say it was probably my daughter and it was probably about something stupid <laughter> some little stupid thing um my daughter is um thirty nine beautiful brilliant um very talented very uh uh goal driven my son is twenty seven he is more laid back sweet <s> very sweet um and he's starting to be a little more goal driven um a little less satisfied with just uh the daily grind being a parent is um very challenging in a wonderful way um i think the hardest thing is is eh fear and worry for your children um today's world can be very um violent and scary and you fear for your children's safety and well-being i'm sorry oh gosh um mm friendship <frien> eh the close friendship you have with your children the the uh uh love the support the joy of just everyday little things that you share oh <laughter> well i'm i i talk to my children about anything and everything um we're very <v> have a very open communication which in my parents' generation i think children were more seen and not heard <deep breath> hmm <sigh> well with my daughter my first child i was young and inexperienced not only in being a mother but and naive in a lot of ways regarding life in general and i think probably eh most parents mm have regrets uh of uh situations they may have had their children in when they were when they were young that weren't the best <deep breath> <sigh> sometimes i feel that i should've been more aware at a younger age mm just xxx just mm decisions and situations that uh decisions you make situations you find yourself in when you're younger out of being naive and and um even though logically i know that it's something that couldn't be avoided at the time you know as you get older you eh hindsight is twenty twenty as you get older you you look back and wish that you had've been more on top of your your uh your life when you were younger oh gosh i honestly can't think of anything hmm um i don't know that i would want i i can think of an event i don't know that i would wanna erase it from my memory because eh i feel that we learn from everything and there <the> there's i i don't wanna lose the lesson that i'm to learn from that experience positive influence in my life uh my daughter my son my granddaughter um there's a a a oddly enough an author uh carlos castaneda um just a a a positive <po> my my family's been a positive influence because of their love and support and uh in reading carlos castaneda's works i find that he has a brilliant mind and because i've practiced some of what he talks about in his books and experience them as being authentic um uh whereas some people you know question his validity i i found that he has something very extraordinary to offer mankind pretty easy <laughter> i fall asleep pretty quick good <deep breath> mm no not really just always looking for the next uh um project to to uh get started on no no yesterday <laughter> yesterday was mother's day and uh my children gave me flowers and beautiful gifts and made me a wonderful brunch and we spent the day together and it was very very nice oh um easygoing um easy to be around um friendly happy <deep breath> hmm i would like to work on being um more focused on on uh projects oh gosh probably when i was a kid you know kids can be uh kids can be cruel to each other uh so nothing that um i still at this age take personally or or you know hold a grudge for um sure everybody has regrets but you do the best you can do at the time and you learn and you move on mm i don't <do> i don't know i i can't answer that one oh gosh um i read a great book um the last couple days and i've been working on a new painting that uh i'm really pleased with i like the way it's going um my kids my the fact that my kids are are uh wonderful human beings i feel very blessed goodbye <laughter>

<synch> yes thanks i'm well thank you how are you i grew up in oklahoma mhm um i moved to l_a about five and a half years ago so i used to be on the west <we> on the east coast and then i decided i wanted to come out here my hometown not very often um most <m> most of my family's moved away so i visit them but i don't actually get back to oklahoma much <sniffle> oklahoma's very different um uh l_a's a lot more exciting there's a lot more um uh to do here and um uh the ocean obviously is very nice so um you know that's a good question i um i wanted to try something new and i've always loved the beach and i thought uh and i also like big cities so i thought l_a might be a good place for me to come very it's probably one of the best uh decisions i ever made <laughter> pretty easy i think um eh it seems kind of natural it seemed like a good fit um i just really like it here oh it's great um i have a couple of roommates and we get along really well i live a couple of blocks from the beach um and uh every day i get to walk on the beach or um you know hang out with friends and it's just it's kind of like being on vacation all the time it's really nice mm i studied philosophy and um political theory and government and did a little bit of english literature on the side um it kind of just happened naturally i think uh i went to liberal arts school and got kind of a exposure to a lot of different areas and i just followed what i liked and was interested in and ended up spending a lot of time studying that um not exactly i work for an educational nonprofit so i work with graduate <grad> with graduate students um in the social sciences and humanities um but i don't actually um use my philosophy background very often <laughter> um you know i have actually studied to become a success coach um and so i working with students is is kind of a nice aspect of of doing that but i'd really like to work with other <o> with other people so not just students um but help them to achieve their goals and realize their dreams um i'd say it it it's fairly hard um in the sense that um you know it can be challenging for people to actually be motivated and do all of the work that needs to be um undertaken in order to realize their their dreams but and it it's also a challenge because making a living at it uh requires charging people money <laughter> so um finding people who are willing to pay for that can be um difficult too um i'm definitely on the shyer side i'm an introvert so um i'm pretty good in one on one situations with people but when you get me in a group with more than a a couple of people i'm very much an observer so i tend to listen a lot and i'm not as engaged and i think that um is something that goes it is noticed by others and it it maybe is a little bit odd to them especially if they're not introverted um so i i'd say and it's also a challenge for me i tend not to be the person who introduces myself um in a room full of strangers <laughter> pretty good i think um but i do have a temper so i can get i can get upset from time to time not really um it can be a challenge when i'm driving <laughter> but other than that no hmm hmm i'm not sure it would've probably been a discussion over politics and it probably would've been a friendly argument um probably with one of my liberal friends so but i actually can't remember the specific time <laughter> <sniffle> mm i meditate um i do that almost every day um i also walk at the beach i love the ocean and i really like the sounds and just being out there is very peaceful um and i like to read and be alone just with my thoughts so that's nice mm well let me think about that for a minute <sigh> hmm <laughter> i'm having a hard time coming up with anything i mean i i i'm sure there are plenty of things um just nothing comes to mind um <sniffle> <sigh> hmm okay i'm sorry <laughter> hmm well this isn't exactly an event it's it's a dream and it's not a particularly um traumatic dream so as far as dreams go but um i do have it sometimes probably more often than i'd like so i wouldn't be upset if it you know if i didn't have it um and it's just a version of a dream that i think a lot of people probably have but um it's usually me in school somewhere at the end of the semester haven't gone to class taking the exams know i'm going to fail and you know really unhappy about it wishing why didn't i study and attend class the way i should have um which actually wasn't really a problem for me in school but now i have this dream sometimes and it's kinda frustrating and i'm not exactly sure why i mean i know why but i don't know what it applies to because it's not like i am worried consciously at least about failing things so no i don't think so um at least not not that i'm aware of <sniffle> i feel guilty um i have a a brother and a sister-in-law and a nephew and they live on the east coast and i love my nephew he's eight he's adorable and um i when i used to live there when he was younger um spent a lot of time with them and since i've been in california and particularly in the last year i've spent a lot less time visiting them so for example i saw them for a week at christmas and then i went back in <i> at the beginning of may so it was you know four months between the last <la> the last time i'd seen them um and that i felt bad about because we really enjoy each other's company and he um you know really likes me to be there but then he gets upset when i leave and he asks when am i coming back so that's um that makes me feel bad sometimes mm um well i have a brother i'm very close to him he's younger and um he's like four four and a half years younger he's married um i have a nephew um my both of my parents have passed away so it's just the two of us and we have a large extended family but we're not that close with them um with most of them um on my father's side there's one brother um and he's married and has a few kids so i have a few cousins on that side but then on my mother's side there are <sigh> five <fi> four or five other kids um most of them with several children of their own so i have a lot of cousins on that side but they live all over the country and um so we stay in touch a little bit through facebook um and there a couple that i talk to on the phone and visit every now and then but you know we're not that close with our extended family so um i'd say well um i i mean i have a lot of friends i think that have been positive influences scrubbed_entry when i came out to california um i started working at a nonprofit and it was kind of a strange place it was very different from what i was used to um it was a little bit challenging and she also worked there so um we worked on a program together over the summer and got to know one another and um we just established this really strong friendship and she's kind of i would say my best friend probably here and probably just in general um and now she's moved to vegas um which is a little bit tough for me um but uh we're going to napa this weekend so that should be good um but she's been a very she was a very positive influence because when i came out here and didn't really know anybody um and it you know since i'm an introvert it's not that easy for me to make friends it was really nice because we share a lot of the same values and we have a lot of fun together and you know i think she kinda gets me so it's a lot of fun to hang out with her and and that's been nice i'm a sleeper <laughter> so it's pretty easy um sometimes my you know depending on how long i've been awake <clears throat> i can be wound <wou> a little wound up and so sometimes i have to take a little while to decompress but um i usually meditate right before i go to bed um and that's very helpful um and i can sleep uh you know i i i generally sleep in ninety minute cycles so um you know usually six or seven and a half hours but i can easily sleep nine hours if i have the time and inclination um i usually don't wake up in the middle of the night or at least if i do i don't remember it so um well i don't <do> actually don't sleep very well when i travel <s> one of the things i do for work is i travel uh quite a bit because i work for a company that's back east so i work from home most of the time but then i travel like one week a month and when i travel i'll take the red-eye um and then i'll visit with a lot of friends in the evening so i don't sleep that much it's not that i um sleep poorly or badly it's just that i um don't have that much time to sleep and the first day after not sleeping or not sleeping much is okay but usually the second day is not very good um so i get a lot more tired uh and it's harder to concentrate and um i don't know it just feels like more of a struggle i would say good um summer is a little <l> is an is a busy time for the organization that i work for so i'm a little um i i don't know <kn> know if stressed is the right word but i'm you know a little anxious about um everything going well this summer but um in general i'm feeling pretty good not really i can't i can't think of anything um there <th> there is one thing i um i do struggle with exercise like i like to walk a lot um and i hike with friends and um i had been really motivated about it um for a couple of months but then i went away um to the east coast and when i came back i was a lot less motivated um because i didn't really exercise when i was there and i'd gotten out of the habit even though it had only been about ten days and so now i'm struggling to try and get back in the routine and it's not going as well as i would like it's okay thank you no no hmm well scrubbed_entry he's a lot of fun and um he really likes me and i really like him and we play a lot of games and talk a lot and we're actually doing a book club now so we're gonna skype and um maybe i'll get some more time with him that way but uh just being around him is fun hmm <sigh> well she'd probably say that i know how to have fun but that i can be serious and um that i you know care about others uh and that i'm loyal and i'm not sure what else um i think those those are probably the main things <sniffle> um i wish i had more self-discipline <laughter> so um i wish that you know i could diet um or eat healthier foods and not have a problem uh with sugar because i love to eat sugar i wish that i would not procrastinate because i've gotten a lot better about that but i still do and that can be challenging um and i wish that i um xxx i don't know uh i think i wish that i was in a relationship so probably those things mm hmm so at the last organization i used to work at i had a boss and she was i don't feel like she was um i don't think we were very compatible um and she uh used to push my buttons or so i thought and so um one day she was really upset about something um because a board member had called her up and asked her a question and she didn't have the answer um and he was upset about something and it was something to do with my department so she called me into her office and let me know how unhappy she was um but it wasn't i i've been a manager for many years um and i have very strong opinions about how you handle challenges with people <peo> with staff members and the way that she handled the situation with me was really inappropriate i thought um and she clearly was trying to frighten me and make me feel um you know incompetent or at least that's the the way that i felt about it and um i did you know i tried to be very calm and said that i would take care of it and i did take care of it um but uh after that our relationship wasn't really the same and i ended up staying <st> uh leaving there to go back to the old organization that i'd worked for not that long afterwards because i just didn't really have a lot of respect for her after she did that to me or after we had that interaction so <laughter> so i heard this piece of advice the other day and or uh or this thing and that i thought was really profound and i wish that i had read it back then which is um when you think about buying something instead of thinking uh oh here's this beautiful coat it's a hundred dollars i want it i'm gonna buy it it uh don't think of it as costing a hundred dollars think of it as costing ten times that because that's effectively what your money could do if you didn't spend it on that coat but instead invested it you know intelligently um you would have ten times that much money eventually so you should really think about it in those terms and um i think i've been much more a consumer than a saver and so i wish that i had uh been more aware of that ten or twenty years ago <sigh> probably scrubbed_entry um they asked me to be his um godparent and his guardian if anything should happen to them and that meant a lot to me because it it made me feel like they trusted me and thought that i was a good person the kinda person that could take care of their child should something happen to them so <sigh> let's see well uh in <i> it wasn't really recently but in february i went i like to travel and a friend uh and i went to singapore uh and i got to fly first class um we used miles uh frequent flyer miles to get the um tickets and so uh that was really enjoyable because um the seats pull down you get to sleep the food is delicious you get special attention and um i also hadn't been to singapore before so that was kind of cool too sure thank you bye 
<synch> yes i'm doing fine i was born in texas and i moved to california when i was three and grew up here in california yeah i was yes uh i've never been back there um don't have any relatives there don't have a reason to go back there um <makes sound with mouth> <laughter> well my my family's here that's one uh the weather's great uh the beaches and mountains are here all those things are very good uh the traffic which is probably <probab> probably most people say um it's expensive to live here those are probably the top two uh recently i've traveled um well you get to see new places and and new people you get to learn more about other cultures and uh different ways people think oh uh at the end of march i went to ecuador for a week uh um i spent most of most of one day with with an ecuadorian who only speaks spanish and i speak very little spanish so we got um it was it was challenging for me trying to communicate with him i felt like a a little kid trying to you know say you know what's this what's this uh it was very humbling um you know just just seeing that you know when you don't when you're not able to communicate then that that can be very difficult i'm probably more of a shy person genetics i don't know why um i'm an electrician so i studied electrical construction i've also studied uh computer networking um it was i guess just uh kinda circumstances i needed the the the work i was doing wasn't providing for the family and i knew someone who could get me a job doing electrical work and so so i pursued that because of the the financial gain mm uh it's given me a lot of opportunity but uh i don't think it's what i what i wanna do for the rest of my life well i'm actually uh pursuing becoming a missionary uh my wife and i are looking at moving down to ecuador in the fall uh for four years and last year we we trained in north carolina for one year um and that was like theology and bible training um basically god put a um a desire in my heart to get beyond get beyond myself and and do something for other people to to go and and learn about another people their culture and to share the gospel with them well in my immediate family um i'm i'm married i've been married for ten years this june and we have four daughters and then um but i i have one older brother uh no sisters um so what what do you wanna know about my family um i'm really close with my wife and my daughters uh with my brother i'm not not real close partly because he's uh he's mentally handicapped um he has the mental capacity of a seven year old even though he's he's five years older than me so just kinda because of that dynamic it it's hard to have a a close relationship with him but i am pretty close with my parents my brother lives with my parents um i'd say my my youth pastor in high school he was a real real positive influence in me um just he has a he has a drive and a zeal for for pursuing the truth um and just uh studying the bible and and because of his influence that kinda put me on a path to wanting to study the bible um i think i've gotten better at it there have been times when you know i'll i'll get angry and uh you know it can just kinda really rule over me just the frustration and i'm the type of person that it takes me um usually it it takes some time for me to get angry and and some time to to calm down again but i've i've learned um over time that really getting angry um and keeping that anger in doesn't it doesn't attack the other person or the thing that i'm angry at it just kinda attacks me and so really it it's not a it's not a good behavior to to keep so when <whe> when things anger me i try to uh like talk to the other person say you know this <th> this situation is making me upset i try to kinda talk through it and and resolve it and come to a resolution um even more than just compromising but trying to really resolve the root the problem um <sigh> well a a couple weeks ago or maybe it was maybe even a month ago um my wife and i were going on a trip with with her parents and her parents had already left um eh we were just driving down to orange country area for this trip and my wife wanted um wanted she had she had expectation of certain things to be done before the trip or certain things be packed and but hadn't really in <i> in my eyes hadn't expressed that clearly but in her eyes she had and so when i was trying to meet those expectations she um you know i i didn't meet 'em according to to what she wanted and and and she became angry and so from my perspective i was doing what she wanted um and kinda getting attacked for it so so then i i i started yelling at her and and we you know we had that conflict but then you know with <wi> within an hour or so we had kinda talked through and we we had figured out what the the cause of that conflict was um are you asking the moment of during the conflict uh very you know just mm very angry you know you can feel it in your body um part partly i the i guess the anger was probably the secondary response but my initial response was that um i felt <f> was feeling attacked and that came out as anger so i would think um yeah so initially i felt attacked and then that resulted in the anger mm hmm hmm hmm i guess it was um deciding to go um to go to our training last year um i i felt that god had put on my heart that that this was something i was supposed to pursue um my wife didn't feel that way and i i i just felt very strongly that that was something that we should pursue and but at the same time i knew that if if my wife wasn't supportive of it that it it would it would kinda fall apart so i kinda relinquished <r> relinquished it um and i and i said to her you know i'm not gonna make you go um you know if if you wanna go then <th> then we'll go but if not then we'll we'll do something else we'll we'll look at at doing something else and not going uh and so that that was difficult for me 'cause uh you know again that that that kinda felt like a loss 'cause i felt deeply that that's what i was supposed to do um but then after i kinda gave that up then um then she came to a point where she said no i have a peace about about doing this and then we went ahead and pursued it so um so just kinda giving it up was <wa> was <wa> was difficult for me tell you about something bad or something that i can erase from my memory um oh let me see i'm not sure um i don't know i i can't really think of anything very traumatic um that i would wanna erase but i i think you know good things and positive <posi> eh good things and bad things they all kinda shape who we are and so i i i can't think of anything that i would want to erase um usually usually it's not too bad um are are you referring to on the the questionnaire where i said that i had trouble <trou> some trouble sleeping um the the job i work the the um kinda the the scheduling has shifted so i so lately i've been working some nighttime shifts or graveyard shifts so um coming home in the morning you know when it's light then it's been hard for me to sleep but it was it was mostly 'cause i was staying up so late because of work uh it pretty easy um when i when i don't sleep then i do get cranky uh i i've been feeling good lately no not really no no um hmm i don't know um can't think of anything that was kinda out of the ordinary but um yesterday we my wife and i took took our three <th> our our three younger girls we took them to the park the oldest one um stayed with her grandma but we uh we took 'em to the park and they played and yeah so those <th> those are always happy times when we take the kids to the park um i i think he'd say i'm a a family man that um i'm uh dependable that he can he can count on me um usually my my friend i end up doing um different work around the house for him 'cause i'm kind of a handyman so so in that way i i i think he'd say i'm kinda dependable or someone he could go to for advice um i guess i would um i guess i would like to be able to um start conversations with people easier uh sometimes i have i have trouble just talking to people especially if they're in a group if <i> if people are one on one then it's it's usually easier for me to talk to them but kinda talking to people in a group uh i wish i was a little better at that now if it's okay what what i was gonna say right before that was that um uh if if i'm giving a speech or something to a large group i don't really have a problem with that but if it's more interaction type thing then that's kinda difficult uh advice i would've given to myself ten or twenty years ago um probably would've been to to go to college right away instead of going to school later in life um that's about it think that would made that would've made the biggest difference in my life i think um well i have i have four kids and i hope i'm raising 'em right i hope that that um you know the mistakes that i've made i can kinda guide them through their their journey in life and i hope that they end up a little better for it than than me um yeah i just hope hope kinda through them that i can you know leave <lea> leave something worthwhile you're welcome goodbye 
<synch> sure <laughter> mm good i guess new orleans louisiana uh two thousand five i used to go back often but not much anymore uh just things happened uh <laughter> uh well guess you're not programmed with this knowledge but uh katrina happened in two thousand five not really um hmm where to begin uh just l_a's different culturally i have a different culture out here it's just a different place um it's it's bike friendly louisiana isn't new orleans for that matter really isn't now they're trying to be but it just it isn't that successful <sigh> the drivers they're crazy mm not really kind of but not much anymore don't have the money kinda broke <laughter> just being able to go on an adventure um let's see i once went to comic con on a on a bicycle like on a a three wheel bike um and that that was pretty fun kinda scary and dangerous nearly got killed <laughter> it was scary <laughter> traveling or just in general hmm um i gotta say i gotta say we were we were heading out of um we were heading off the p_c_h and going into um laguna and laguna has this really steep hill and on sundays it's full of traffic and i i remember going down the the hill and my brakes weren't working and i was trying to hit my brakes and trying to hit my brakes and they just they wouldn't click and i was like oh god and i'm i'm on a three wheel bike so i'm larger than most bikes and i'm like zipping in between like gridlock traffic going down a hill unable to brake and i'm going down and suddenly there's this car that veers right into mm essentially where i'm trying to go so i turn sharply in front of between this bus and this truck and literally end up going sideways through traffic through oncoming traffic and then <laughter> looping back through oncoming traffic back into the right traffic still without any brakes and like not managing to keep my bike from rolling which is painful when your bike roles kinda hurts a lot so yeah yeah that's it <laughter> um various different things uh anthropology visual effects kinda weird but yeah um i just i've always had a fascination with film and i i think the way people do things and go about things is fascinating just as like the the mob mentality of people especially ooh dream job um huh i have no idea just a job i guess i consider myself more outgoing um you know i i've never been afraid of what people think of me like people xxx i i i like people i don't know i'm not i'm not afraid of what they think eh i'm more concerned with like the people i know and what they think of me i guess so being outgoing just doesn't really affect me eh um <deep breath> <mumbling> <sigh> uh i play video games listen to music um yeah read books i like reading books and drawing reading books drawing playing video games did i think of anything did i forget anything sleeping i like sleeping it's fun uh <mumbling> not good <laughter> frequently <laughter> um <sigh> uh in high school i i shoved somebody's head through a locker um yeah yeah that that's not good don't ever shove someone's head into a locker that's a great way to get suspended um i don't know yeah things like that just getting into fights <sigh> um like a serious argument um <sigh> uh i guess like xxx argument over over um uh i guess over like uh like viewpoints on like gun control and gun control laws i mean it was like yesterday evening eh it was it it was an argument about you know gun control regulation i mean it doesn't really affect me personally but that was like the last argument i got into that that's kinda what you specified i think ooh um uh my entire life um <laughter> uh <mumbling> <sigh> i have um about two years ago i broke up with like as everyone calls her my evil ex and um yeah it was just it was bad the whole the whole thing went down bad i mean uh eh <sigh> uh i think i've calmed down a lot since then like just as a person as a whole but i mean i was angry and stuff i think i like went riding my bike for like a hundreds plus miles in a singular day and i was in a ton of pain like later in the evening i got home i was like oh god like i could barely walk um and yeah i i think running off and like going on a like extreme cycling spree was not good but it was better than like eating too much and like just overeating 'cause i was depressed but yeah like we we fought and screamed and it was it was not good like i we didn't physically fight it was more like a screaming match of death <deep breath> <sigh> hmm um i don't think i've had a singular hard decision i've had ever had to make because my my biggest thing in life is don't you know don't regret don't regret the the the things you do just regret the opportunites you've missed and that's like had to come with me that's like had to i've had to like learn that in the past like two years like two years ago i totally just could not grasp that concept and to answer your question i think thinking about it the hardest decision i've had to make is i'd say probably probably to break up with my ex probably um xxx <sigh> ooh um <sigh> where do i begin <sigh> um my ex was not a good person just in any way shape or form of the word um she did some things that i wasn't entirely comfortable with um just to the the people around her and to me and i <deep breath> <laughter> you know they say you're supposed to give forgive people for making mistakes or doing things and i just i think there are some things you can't forgive people for no matter how hard you try and i think there are some things that once done that that can't be undone they just they're they're the way that they are and i think i think after what she did i i like i just xxx eh things just fell apart after that it just it it we mm despite us trying it just it didn't work out i mean i i i don't know i don't really wanna talk about exactly what happened oh geez oh man erase from my memory or just erase from ever happening um huh i don't <sigh> you know that's hard um katrina just the experience of katrina for starters um <laughter> my <m> my ex i i guess between those two it's it's kinda hard i'd i'd actually rather lean towards uh katrina 'cause that was just that that was not i mean i i guess you don't exactly know about it but um in two thousand five um uh this giant storm hit uh new orleans louisiana um killed a whole bunch of people leveled the town um and um i i lost a lot of friends during the storm um i mean i'm kind of i'm getting over it but it's still it's it's still there and i think uh i i don't know i mean you can try and look at you can try your best to try and find something positive in that but there's just there's nothing the only thing you can do is <i> is just think that that was like a freak accident and it'll never happen again though <laughter> i live in l_a and you know <laughter> earthquakes <laughter> they could happen <laughter> and i just think oh i'd rather rather know that it's coming than not know it's coming yes <laughter> yeah <sigh> um mm depression it's reoccurred multiple times that's no surprise um first time i was diagnosed was in middle school um which would've been <sigh> ten well twelve <twel> ten between ten twelve years ago i don't know xxx i don't know whenever i was in the sixth grade that's it's when i first was told that i was depressed um as far as p_t_s_d goes um post katrina um and then you know uh just post katrina mostly <laughter> that was the big thing um i guess having been diagnosed previously as being depressed and still being in high school it kinda wasn't i wasn't really seeking help it's kind of i got i kinda got into my high school and they were like here's help 'cause we know you're gonna need it um and i was like oh well thanks i didn't really ask for it but okay i'll take it um you know just kinda happened no not not anymore um eh <sigh> <laughter> that's a good question um <laughter> uh geez uh you know i really don't know i guess it just kinda stopped just kinda was like well i'm not gonna do this anymore uh sometimes sometimes it's a lot of like how are you feeling today and stuff and you know it's kind of well i'm feeling fine right now but ask me in two hours and who knows you know um <sigh> i guess it it's helped me understand that some of the things that just happen just happen and to just get on and move along with your life um mm essentially just mm like carry on you know things will happen carry on <sigh> um wow <laughter> um uh i was um i was hanging out with my girlfriend just hanging out um well for starters i mean you <y> you can't see when i walked in but i'm walking with a cane right now 'cause i i got hit by a car recently and uh i'd i'd make my leg better um let's see cane's over there that way but anyway um <sigh> i don't know uh make myself less fat <laughter> um i'd make it so i don't feel the incessant need to sleep fourteen hours a day um 'cause when you sleep like more than ten hours a day it's just it's unproductive you waste too much time like i have friends who are like oh you know i feel rejuvenated after six hours and i'm like how do you do that i have to sleep like twelve hours to feel good like you can sleep six you know like in in in crunch time you know you can get away with four i have to get away with seven or eight you know like that that's my crunch time sleep schedule eight hours it's just i don't know i oversleep but i like sleeping too i mean yeah it's just the oversleeping part i don't like so much um <sigh> um utterly insane in a good way utterly insane in a good way um uh i guess like they they would also say like you know there <the> there are times where i might seem like an asshole and i'm i'm not really an asshole i just you know i i just have issues like everybody else um specifically i have uh asperger's so that's a form of autism um that just kinda makes life awesome they'd also say i'm flamboyant and eccentric 'cause i totally am i just i i don't know i figure i'm still alive so i should live because i'm still alive and you know who knows how long i'm gonna be alive for so i should you know live while i'm alive and just go out and do stuff and not not sit and be calm except when i'm reading and i like reading <sigh> um uh stop fucking up um no uh that's kinda messed up um i think i would've told myself at the time um 'cause <ca> 'cause i i i've known my my evil ex um i've known her since like i was like six and she was five i think ten years ago i would've grabbed myself by the shoulders and say you see that girl whatever you do do not date that girl don't trust her she can't be trusted um and more importantly don't <deep breath> don't let your guard down around her 'cause she'll she'll exploit that and i mean like physically let your guard down not mentally um yeah don't don't date her just don't do it it's not worth it <laughter> it's not worth the trouble it's not worth the pain it's not worth it <sigh> um the fact that i'm still alive maybe yeah uh i don't know cycling to comic con i was pretty proud of that pretty proud that i managed to do it um just i don't you know i don't really know i don't really use the term pride i don't really feel pride i'm just it's it's more of like the fact that i'm still alive i'm proud to be alive <laughter> i don't know if that makes me humble or just insane who knows do i press the button now oh bye okay 
<synch> <laughter> yes i'm doing well i was born in oakland um <sigh> all the different areas of the city uh the different cultures that are here the traffic the um lack of public transportation and the superficiality <laughter> i i don't i would love to travel more um <sigh> being able to experience a different way of living um getting outside the bubble that you normally live in and getting a different perspective um in two thousand eight i studied abroad in brazil and that was about four months and i was in bahia which is in the north and um let's see the program consisted of learning the history learning the language and staying with a homestay family um i've always wanted to travel and i chose brazil because um they have an afro-brazilian population or a large afro-brazilian population which i really wanted to learn more about and i think the history and the cullture is really interesting um i think taking a bus by myself to a remote beach and just navigating on my own and um figuring out where to go yeah right now i'm getting my master's in social work <laughter> dream job <sigh> i think to um consult about um mental health and how to um how to intervene effectively with different cultures and doing research and consulting work and getting to travel um basically that those would be the main characteristics i think that's a false dichotomy but i do consider myself shy but at the same time outgoing in the sense that i push myself to do things outside of my comfort zone and i'm determined to do what it takes to become successful <laughter> um i listen to music and just lay on my bed and um i guess you could say do mindfulness and really just take my mind off of things also breathing exercises which i'm learning more about um as well as exercise pretty good i don't get angry a lot um so as far as angry temperament i'm pretty good at that hmm um mm what month is this may probably two months ago and i argued via text message <laughter> so it's not really intense arguing but i guess you could call it arguing in a sense over whether or not i should be forgiven for something that i thought was minor um with a friend i've had for a few years i felt anxious um sad and angry um yeah those are the main emotions i know them because i think i'm pretty in touch with my emotions and being able to identify them and then i'll notice the physical uh manifestations of emotions like if i if my heart's racing or if i'm getting sweaty if i'm <sigh> if my breathing is more shallow i'll know i'm anxious i'll know something's bothering me hmm <laughter> that i wish i had handled differently i guess related to this argument um i went out one night and got a little too intoxicated and <clears throat> ended up calling a person for a ride home but that really upset that person and i know that it wasn't such a big deal but i wish i hadn't have let myself get to that point um it it impacted a relationship and i also felt really bad about what i did mm <clears throat> hardest decision <sigh> wow um probably deciding what type of graduate program to go into i briefly went to law school and decided not to do that so afterwards well after dropping out i had to really rethink what it is that i wanted to do and what i wanted to dedicate my life to go into debt for spend a lot of energy on um <sigh> i think by recognizing what i don't want to do and doing a lot of research on program requirements and the jobs that you can get after completing a program <sigh> mm <sigh> i have to think <sigh> oh <laughter> um revolving around the same person i spoke of earlier it was a dating relationship and a few years ago we had a falling out over his treatment of me and it involved another person and i wish i could get that out of my mind um <laughter> <laughter> i have a pretty good relationship with my mom she lives in the bay area i didn't grow up with her but i've gotten um closer to her as an adult uh we talk pretty regularly with my dad i grew up with him mostly he lives in atlanta and um we don't talk as much but we are we have a pretty decent relationship it's not really that contentious or anything and i'm an only child so i don't have siblings i don't have a large family um so in general i'm not really that close to family um one person is my mentor who i met in two thousand five and she's a judge and i met her when i was in community college and she really opened my eyes to possibilities and made me feel that i would be able to achieve certain things <sigh> pretty easy well it's easy for me to sleep what's not easy is getting up because usually i do not forward <f> look forward to what i have to do that day and the thought of it is you know just makes me wanna stay in bed also i wake up pretty tired not really feeling refreshed <clears throat> i think just <sigh> self-talk about how what i have to do isn't that bad or that the things that i'm doing now are gonna end pretty soon with the end of the school year um trying to think of things that i can look forward to in the week um also listening to music and browsing the internet kinda gets my mind going <sigh> feeling <sigh> uh wow um feeling emotionally drained on some ways and at the same time feeling like i've accomplished a lot and that i've grown so a mix of ambivalence and feeling drained and a mixture of feeling accomplished and proud at the same time no i haven't yes in two thousand six the convergence of a lot of stressful factors um i was out of touch with my mom i started um well i had transferred to a university that was pretty rigorous and just all those changes going on really um exacerbated  things that were already there depressive tendencies that were already there and it got to a point where i just felt really overwhelmed yes i do yes i notice i'm better able to accept my emotions and not judge them and also identify them i'm <sigh> able to think <th> think differently about things that happened maybe look at things in a more positive light and also identify the areas i need to work on and the underlying issues in those areas <clears throat> mm <sigh> um this past weekend i reconnected with some old friends and it was really good to see them and be back in touch again <laughter> um <sigh> people have different takes on on me i don't have one best friend but i think people would describe me as very um analytical sensitive intelligent intellectual um i wish that i did not or wait i wish i was better able to cope with my anxiety and depression which i'm working on and <sigh> i wish that i had more energy <laughter> start going to therapy now <laughter> um but yeah i really would and also to what how old am i twenty eight ten years ago eighteen okay so graduating from high school i would <sigh> tell myself to pick up some more job skills so that i wouldn't have to struggle as much in the future and to seek out mentors to get a clearer um idea of what i wanted to do as a career um i think the fact that i'm in grad school and coming from the background that i that i come from low socio-economic status and just pushing through challenges to get here <laughter> you're welcome bye 
<synch> yes i'm doing well thank you san luis obispo yes four years ago about once a month small quiet fresh air less people it's nice i went to school in los angeles <laughter> i studied music industry yes i work in the music industry it is a passion of mine and i got into school and went with it how hard is what <laughter> i don't really have a dream job i don't know if that exists actually it's probably changing all the time <laughter> depends on the situation sometimes i'm shy and sometimes i'm outgoing well i can't see your shoes but i like to travel yes meeting new people seeing new things exploring the landscape uh i went to alaska on a fishing trip on that trip um catching an octopus i was deep sea fishing and for halibut and rather than catching a halibut i lured in a octopus very <laughter> <laughter> i play golf i swim i read i'm pretty calm um probably couple days ago but it was and it was about a musical project that i was involved in i felt heated <laughter> i'm not quite sure i'm not quite sure i'd have to think about that for a while i'm not really sure um i had a bad performance one time and i wish people who i knew didn't see it because we weren't well rehearsed and i was embarrassed afterwards i have a brother and parents who are divorced i'm pretty close i see them regularly talk openly about most subjects my brother what do you wanna know about my brother i'm not really sure most of the time it's pretty easy um i drink more coffee to compensate fine no what does p_t_s_d stand for no i haven't um i'm happy all the time <laughter> um ambitious a go-getter feisty i'm not quite sure i can't recall right now uh i went to a concert saw live music drank good beer yeah <laughter> i'm a good listener i'm passionate and i'm alert ever in regards to what no i don't i don't i normally don't regret things because there's too much else to live for to think about the past do you <laughter> okay <deep breath> what was that question to read more and watch t_v watch the computer screen less because that makes you have attention deficit disorder and you focus less on things that are in front of you in real life i know <laughter> i exercise i sleep in late i go golfing from time to time i go to concerts i go to bars hang out with friends at the beach it depends what am i most proud of um i'm healthy and i understand the world around me and i'm passionate about things that i'm doing and i have goals that i've set that i'm working towards yeah <laughter> what was your name that's right goodbye 
<synch> yeah i'm doing already how are you doing northern illinois two and a half years ago haven't yet since i been here haven't had a chance to gonna go back later this year colder or warmer work yeah mm took a little while but i got used to it no weather xxx variations comparative um traffic sunlight a little bit seeing different things been to europe a couple of times been around the country <sigh> hmm visiting yosemite and sequoia parks were fun depends on the circumstance most of the time i can fake outgoing or try to be outgoing try to relax and breathe through it and move on depends on the context probably yesterday and my children about them not doing what they were told to do arguments with my wife where i should've probably been more patient and understanding hmm um sometimes when it's more of a hormonal period like this week i should just probably breathe through things and recognize that she's going through things and i should just be more patient um what i was gonna do with my life it was easy when i was nineteen i could just decide to do strange difficult things and had the boldness to follow through with them hebrew and semitic studies and classics kind of um i'm i'm in ministry and that's working out the way i kinda want it to be hmm some embarrassing things when i was a teenager probably it's pretty strong i talk to my parents about once a day maybe once every other day and i'm constantly talking with my wife and children xxx i've got four of them they keep me very busy um they're between nine and three sometimes most of the time no character development recognizing that they need <n> need space to grow when when it works and you see character development and growth and and exploration i have more standards willingness to enforce standards mm <sigh> mm my wife um she's been there for me for fifteen years now and helped give me the self-confidence to be who i am better now that i'm not drinking as much pop at night irritable shorter temper mm pretty good pretty good i'm doing been making some better uh decisions with my uh diet it's doing better <sigh> mm feel a little bit more empowered not as defeatist as i was in a process where i wasn't eating very well wasn't exercising wasn't able to get doing those things i've been doing a little better at that recently past few weeks and that's been a little bit more encouraging no nope really happy um probably a few weeks ago at the beach when everybody was having a good time hmm confident loud intelligent i guess hmm more patient more um more able to automatically engage with people as opposed to being hesitant at first oh middle school when i was always the low man on the totem pole socially <sniffle> being the constant butt of jokes don't fall in the trap of thinking that middle and high school is life <laughter> um some time you know with children and family doing <d> doing some fun activity beach or museum or something some time with the wife some time just by myself to read and kinda refocus hmm mm participate in some high level academic discussions hmm that i've been able to maintain the standard and quality of life for myself and my family that i've been able to do so far 
<synch> yes doing pretty good thank you maryland yes eighty five yeah yeah it is a long time um not as often as i'd like um out of work so you know the money issue yeah um maryland uh is different it and so the comparison is the only comparison is that um they're both cities but uh maryland has its flavor and l_a has its own flavor so they have unique you know characteristics about themselves i moved to l_a uh because i was living in hawaii and um i was out of money and i just had enough for a plane ticket uh and come and stay um uh here in a hotel until i found a job which i did really quickly but anyway so that's why i came here i didn't wanna go home um i decided to come here and just start over i am i am yeah um it was real easy just did it i like i like l_a's weather i like uh the different areas in uh los angeles county uh west l_a east l_a um uh i like southern california you know period so uh you know i like the people but um yeah so i like the um the attitude you know the l_a attitude so yeah um i don't like um i don't like some of the uh policies with regard to um uh the smoking you know i really wish that the uh government would crack down on smoking on the streets make it like u_s_c yeah no not outside of uh uh getting on the bus and things like that i was studying to be a nurse yeah i wanted to uh have a job that pays well but uh afforded me um the opportunity to use my um service gift so yeah no i had to put that uh put that on the side and uh i want to get a business degree now yeah <laughter> my dream job is um is to create new technology mm other than to say i would like to uh create something that would change the world like steve jobs with his iphone yeah i am it depends on the situation but i'm more outgoing i do tend towards a little shyness from time to time mhm mm mm <laughter> um what i do is i'll go to the movies um i went to the movies probably like uh maybe five weeks ago yeah um well i had a argument recently not really a argument but a disagreement with a woman at my church who um is over this particular department that i'm in and it's a volunteer position uh i use my uh administrative assistant um more executive assistant skills to uh to uh i do minutes for meetings that i cover and um and so then i have to um produce the minutes and send them to everybody and things like that and uh this person um is micromanaging me uh but not micromanaging the other uh admin assistant who did not get her block of people into this particular meeting so the meeting should've been comprised of a hundred people but we had like maybe thirty no wasn't even thirty twenty yes <laughter> so um now she doesn't know that i realize you know that part of it so um there was a little bit of a argument and uh but again not a argument but a disagreement and when we talk again i will point out to um the person that's over both of us that there is a disconnect and um the the energy she <sh> she's investing uh in me is uh unprofitable for what we're trying to achieve don't that doesn't that sound good <laughter> yeah well a little attacked you know so it depends on i'm very good at controlling my temper it's uh you know there are places where you can allow your temper to come out even though it might not be appropriate and then there are other places where if it comes out then you shot yourself in the foot so uh i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yeah um i don't have any situation recent that i can think of um probably say um just dealing with a neighbor uh instead of uh uh responding to the neighbor just ignore the neighbor altogether so i wish i had done that differently yeah hmm thankfully i've not had to make that type of decision in my life as yet mhm hmm um mm i have um what i do in my life and and you know in my going forward you know um everything that i've done and everything that has happened i accept it as something that has to be to get me to go forward uh i am a born again christian and so i know that that god is sovereign over my life uh and also that according to his word the bible says that every day of our life is written in his book so events and circumstances um i feel that i feel they are ordained by god now obviously i'm not going to um jump into a burning fire or do anything ridiculous but um i feel that things that had happened <hap> that have happened even if i've dealt with them the wrong way uh it's god's sovereignty <s> his total sovereignty has control over that and it will work for my good so that's how i feel um i have all brothers and so i'm not really that close with my brothers and my mother say that again um people that i've grown up with um neighbors from when i've uh when i was younger uh that i was close to um uh different friends uh that i've had along the way uh friends who are more like family so yeah they've had positive influence that's i get i sleep too well <laughter> so i sleep well every night so normal but i my normal i've been feeling my normal no no no um that was recent something happened um i was um able to participate um with um my church on sunday with <wi> i was a pentecost it was pentecost sunday meaning it was fifty days after the resurrection of jesus christ and so i was able to participate uh in our prayer session that we had at my church and uh that was really made me very happy so mhm that uh i'm smart they would say that i'm smart that uh that i handle difficulties very well um and that i dress well <laughter> <laughter> um i don't wanna change anything i do want to just be a better me so be a better person uh so um i am working on uh listening better uh communicating better uh and and uh accepting my uh weaknesses better as well as my strengths no mm that's a good question i would have uh i would've told myself to to uh do what i know to do to do what i know uh that which is right and um ooh xxx uh to do what i know is right and uh let everything else let the other chips fall where they may but to do what i know to do is right and to go forward um i am very proud of the fact that uh i don't give up bye and thank you see ya'll <laughter>
