okay how 'bout yourself here in california yeah oh well that it's big and broad there's a lot to do a lot of um um job opportunities than other states um pretty much that it's big and there's a lot you can do here traffic um maybe the violence rate bad news even though you know you wanna know what's going on in your environment but you still have to watch it so you can you know look out to see what's going on on a daily basis sociology i have a um two year degree in liberal arts but my major was sociology no i'm actually an m_t_a bus operator well since metro is steady growing um my dream job is to move up in the company and i'm about to actually start some classes for supervisory next week so um 'cause they look to promote within the company so that's the good thing there's a lot of opportunities at metro where you can take classes and they'll pay for your tuition and things of that nature thanks well it's not actually hard as right now it's easy if you take advantage of it right now 'cause they look to promote within so you know so since i'm already working there that's a good thing so it's good to go ahead and take the classes that you need that you're interested in and go ahead and move up the ladder as soon as possible  what do you mean i'm sorry okay read take a long walk hot bath meditate just close my eyes sometimes i'm pretty much good because see by me being a bus operator you run into circumstances and situations you gotta remain calm and still remain professional at the same time well i look at it like it it goes with i mean it comes with experience you know um you do something on a continuous basis usually you some somewhere down the line you become good at it you know so i i look at it like that so i've been driving for years and dealing with the public so it's just how you handle circumstances you you know treat people like you wanna be treated no i'm pretty good at it now maybe when i was younger you know you as you get older you get wiser you learn different things and i'm still learning today i would say my family you know my kids you know even though you know i had been having a lot of deaths around me but that's just go that's part of the life experience you know you born here but you gotta leave here one day but my kids will keep me you know sane and you know i love them and my family   thank you no <laughter> um setting good examples you know because you're the first teacher you know and you wanna set a positive good example for your kids and i think that's a good thing and it starts at home well um by you being the first teacher your kids you're you're their one that they see on a daily basis when they wake up so whatever's been taught in the home they lookin' and learning every day you know whether it's a home school you know people kids have a tendency to do things what they see you know what i mean  so you try to keep it positive teach 'em good morals and values and how to get along with other people regardless of race and you know different things of that nature i have a um four and a half year old son i have a seven year old daughter and i also have a twenty three year old yeah i'm 'bout to be well my daughter's pregnant with a boy she has three um little girls so i have three grandkids and um one on the way which is a boy this time yeah thank you the hardest thing is well right now i'm a single parent so that makes it hard alone itself you know and they can be expensive at times you know it depends on the person's situation you know the whether they have help or a job you know things of that nature to help the situation better but it's hard you know but you i try to you know keep a job keep food in the house you know just maintain and support my kids the best way i can with my kids or just period what's memorable for me is that i'm the only one in my family with a degree so it's kinda like yeah it's kinda even though i'm the baby of ten kids you know and i've always kept that in the back of my mind even though everybody well pretty much my whole family have decent job but i'm the only one with a degree so i kinda like gave myself a pat on the back like you know you know i just that's the only thing i remember graduating you know and my family there and to support me  thank you happy that i accomplished something you know just even though it may not be much but it was better than just have having a high school diploma and i had um i was working on my bachelor's degree but i ended up in a bad car accident i never went back i got distracted and you know i was working at the same time but i was just like moreso i needed income than than um schooling at that time because i was a young parent you know 'cause i had my daughter at seventeen so i was like i needed the money to support her but i never went back but i feel like it's never too late so i feel like i'll take some classes now that i'm with metro to help me move up the ladder so  that's why i'm starting a class next week thank you hm well the advice i would've gave myself that i probably wouldn't have been a young mother at a young age and that i probably would've stayed in school you know not let the accident just distract me and not i would've remained in school i probably wouldn't have had kids early you know um rather i probably would've stayed in school and probably have a part time job or something just i just feel like um education is a excellent thing for a person just having knowledge and learning different things keeping your mind open to learning new ideas every day so i think that's a plus you know in anybody's shoes just to better they selves you know through education maybe to um maybe promote within your company or whatever the case may be that they help better your career i'm not quite sure um you learn from your mistakes you know but at the same time you don't continue to make the same ones i feel like it's okay to make a mistake but long as you do something to change you know um like myself even though i'm going to school late but still i'm going you know i wanna better myself career wise so  yes my oldest daughter we had a argument because just the life that she's living right now and the things that she's going through and um i had told her that she just needed to make some changes to better her situation and uh we got into an argument because you know how your kids sometimes don't wanna hear it you know hear the stuff that you're saying even though it's true or  or they just you know well they just don't wanna hear it you know they may be going through something they don't wanna hear but we got into a argument about it but that just happened you know i just told her i'm not i'm sorry very close very close it's just that the the situation my daughter's in she just needs to make some changes to better her her life and I'll be telling she's um she's kinda like stubborn in her own way you know i was raised to listen to your mom you know your mom's not gonna tell you nothing wrong and i've been telling her over the years you know different things and it's it's kinda like i was talking to a wall because she she did the opposite and now she's she regretting it you know 'cause she's like my mom told me this you know mom i'm doing the opposite so i guess she gotta bump her head a couple of times to get it it's kinda like i done told you i done left it alone and now it's up to you to make the change it's very frustrating because it's like i'm talking to a wall and she's not hearing me and i'm like it seem like it's taking forever for her to change but it's left up to the individual whenever they're ready you know what i mean once the person get tired of something they'll make it change it may not be when you want it to happen but the ball is her court you know i only can do so much oh wow i have my days um since i have two little ones um i kinda like trained them to go to bed at eight o clock because you know they gotta go to school and i think it's important to have a good night's rest because it kinda like <clears throat> it it kinda like gets you ready for the next day or you know how you gonna feel if you rested what type of person you'll be that day you know 'cause everybody have they days whether they're good or bad but that's just a part of life and i feel like if you had a good night's good good night's rest hopefully you'll have a good day you know pretty much you know i need my rest because i'm out there driving that bus and dealing with all these people and you know  the job itself if very stressful so i feel like if i'm rested it'll help me what am i like irritated tired um lazy you know feel like i wanna lay down probably go to sleep <laughter> get the rest that i need but <laughter> i never thought about that i just you know 'cause like i said you know everybody have their moments they do i never thought about that hm no no i don't really have a best friend but a person that i deal with and i used to work with um she would probably tell you that i'm very um outgoing a go getter dependable responsible i'm a um people person i get along with others you know i'm kinda like um i leave a good a a good mark whether i know you or not if you was to you know like  like you and i now you know i um you'd probably say oh she seems like a nice young lady or whatever you know something like that thank you well i try to stay happy i'd rather be happy than sad my kids keep me going you know what i mean especially when i go to pick them up from school or their being hey mom you know that just kinda make my day just them run up to me you know and be happy and excited you know what i mean  thank you you're more than welcome you have a good day goodbye 
i'm doing good um from los angeles california um the cool weather the beaches the people the schools  um child development yes to be a teacher for special education it's not hard 'cause i love to work with children yes dishonesty maybe um like if a guy like especially when it comes to relationships when they lie to you about something that's very minimal my mom i wanna say my mom um very close we talk every day very close even though i don't live with them i try to see them as much as i can uh it's okay <laughter> it's it's good it's yes i do  um they're they're friendly it's just that they're very quiet 'cause i'm not used to that environment it's fine like the how much it costs is very cheap so that's good and they're friendly so it's fine I just wish it was a little bit it could've been better so yeah  yes <laughter>  um i had a different option to live with somebody else and i'm still friends with the female and comes to find out that we connect more than the roommates that I live with so I kinda regret moving in with the roommates I have now versus who i was supposed to move with in the beginning so but i'm stuck for a year so it's whatever  that's fine how do i know who i yeah <laughter> there's nothing that really gets me really mad that i can think of the top of my head um um maybe when it comes to schools how they treat the children especially children of color maybe  that really gets me mad mm yes  because i do things from within i guess so um internally motivated to do things i guess yeah yeah wow i hardly ever argue with somebody <laughter> yeah oh my sister i guess my sister that was about a month ago uh i felt very betrayed and belittled because she's my little sister and she shouldn't be disrespecting me in any type of way because i'm an adult so yeah i was not feeling the situation at all um just her getting into grown folks' business and it was a conversation between me and my mother and i guess she overheard what was being said and she felt like through my actions that i was choosing somebody else over my family when that wasn't even the case but because she didn't know the whole situation she just automatically assumed and put stuff on facebook about me disrespecting me calling me out by name and it was just yeah so <laughter>  and she then comes to me about it like she did all this other stuff on facebook i don't that's one thing i don't like either is when you i hate indirect comments like if you have if you need to talk to me come directly to me don't put it on facebook tell other people that's a pet peeve of mine so i really don't like that yeah so but i mean we're fine now so that's good yeah to not  believe people so easily so gullible to not be so gullible i guess i've been hearing that lately how i believe anybody anything that somebody says without really thinking about it or without having them prove it so i guess you could say i let i made a lot of mistakes i don't wanna say i regretted it because i'm glad i went through it while i was younger than me getting older and going through the same situations so um yeah i believe people too easily and i give people too much chances  so yeah when i went on a cruise which was a happy experience when i went on a cruise to mexico with my family um  when i was sixteen about six years ago yeah <laughter> yeah i mean yeah i guess it was <laughter> no i really want to though um trying new things seeing new views of the world um trying the different type of foods um seeing how the government is and how they run the things out there i guess um yeah i plan to go to the bahamas next year i plan to do a lot of traveling next year actually so yeah it's pretty good eh somewhat i'm tired <laughter> and i kind of fall asleep during class and whatnot yeah it's my fault though um probably today yeah well i fell asleep late so <laughter> it's my fault um no i feel pretty happy right now mhm no no no very friendly and funny talkative um through high school  we're pretty close we try to talk as often as possible maybe once a week i'll try to see them at least every few months mm they're everywhere <laughter> um yeah no comment on that they're more smarter they are learning more stuff than we learned back in the day they are learning they're very progressing but when it comes to technology they're not outside they're always on the computer on their phones they don't play outside no more they don't care about nature or the little things in life they just yeah but when it comes to their mentality they argue smarter 'cause the schools are getting better i ain't gonna lie so  when what happened i was just okay um last weekend i guess right now um  what did i do um being with my boyfriend makes me really happy so i was just hanging out with him last weekend and i never really get to see him that much so yeah   'cause he works i have school different schedules it's not that bad <laughter> um he's my boyfriend i've been knowing for what about six months now  we met through a mutual friend um  in l_a i guess okay you're welcome bye 
i'm doing alright uh originally i'm from california uh born in glendale i'm not too happy with it uh just unemployed at the moment but uh actively seeking uh uh doing what i'm supposed to be doing uh there are some uh  some prospects there but hopefully i'll learn something today yeah well i have one it's a girlfriend so i consider her a roommate a lover type thing pardon me um we're pretty close uh i met her last year and uh we've been through some troubling times but uh we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel uh the troubling times uh i would let me see uh well i had uh gotten a d_u_i last year and uh lost my job i'm a truck driver by trade so  uh that kinda threw me way off uh having a fourteen hundred dollar a week job uh and then going to nothing kinda like plus losing my my license kinda really threw me off and uh I couldn't um i haven't really uh found anything that i was interested in uh so i started cooking and our trying to see which other route i can go as far as uh having some kind of a career and uh so i'm choose choosing to go into the culinary field but you know uh meanwhile i still have to work it's hard to find work with uh without going to school  and uh so but i think today uh i applied at ralphs so hopefully i'll get that job i should have that job actually so um but i'm starting to see a light like i said at the end of the tunnel now a little by little my dream job would be probably forestry service out in the wilderness yeah i like being alone pardon me well you know i have a a lot of for animals i'm an exotic animal trainer by trade and uh so and i like  being i don't like people too much uh so being outdoors and uh i've always enjoyed being outdoors that's how i like being a truck driver i've traveled the world i don't necessarily like being in a warehouse or an office i'm of a a outdoors type of guy so uh one of my trips would be uh i spent a year and a half in japan and uh on the uh lower island uh there that uh they built that bridge  uh the largest bridge in the world uh and uh i went there to work for  uh for an all white oh uh an all white tiger act and uh working for a japanese circus  so it was interesting that a lot of people on that island hadn't really seen a lot of americans  'cause that was also one of the islands that we uh that they bombed  so there was a lot of negativity but i i pretty have a good idea out you know outlook uh on life uh especially during those times you know i i enjoyed myself you know through all the traveling and and meeting new people and um eating you know different um diverse foods and uh it was a good experience for me  all of that whole experience was pretty good for me you know just traveling around with circuses and uh  you know it's been great uh probably um one some of the things i like about l_a there's not a lot that i like about l_a but um i like hollywood i like the the the movie industry um the uh huge uh um different different people you know different uh different ethnics of uh people here you know uh i enjoy talking to uh few you know a lot of foreigners you know i like to see where they came from and and what what it's like there  traffic's atrocious you know traffic <laughter> uh ignorance uh being disrespected uh being disrespectful or whatever you know other people being disrespectful toward you or other people um that's about it dishonesty pardon me uh it happens on a daily basis it seems like you know i ride the bus a lot so uh you know or i if i'm riding my bike uh people tend to almost run me over so if i'm not totally paying attention to traffic uh you know i find myself sometimes you know having to wait to see what they're gonna do instead of i having the right of way or uh something like that yeah big time what do i do when i'm annoyed um probably sit there and uh sit there and vent you know uh speak my mind even though a lot of times it's i'm myself you know just like you know assholes or whatever you um well you know i carry rocks in my back pocket so i can it you know it happens so much where i i just it just amazes me at what people will do sometimes you know you almost get run over all you know i i probably almost get run over probably on a daily basis   and if i wasn't paying attention i'd be up shit creek uh it's hard with dealing with people especially trying not to react 'cause there's consequences for your reactions um it was with my girlfriend and uh it was about being honest uh  um i'm pretty honest with i'm open and honest about any anything and everything and uh what it was about was uh just her lying to me uh telling me that she had told our landlord something and and that she had done something and that and that aspect and i come to find out a week later that it was a total lie so i just you know didn't like that at all pardon me um i'm trying to i'm missing the word for it uh just that i don't know now that whether i could believe anything she says now so it was it was uh i felt hurt you know uh that you know here we had been in a relationship for a little bit and well that's probably one of my biggest uh pet peeves is is being honest  um i don't like i said i don't hold back and i'm pretty honest in anything and everything that i do or say so you know and if you're lying about something well you just you're always having to cover up uh more lies with the lies that that you already told and i just don't see any you know so it kinda took a lot from uh me trusting her now or you know whatever now i'm i you know is it truthful is it not you know so it's kinda hurt our relationship can't do nothing about it uh fun i like going to the beach uh i love shooting darts but i haven't done it in a while i i love i love to paint uh i got into watercolor painting  and i'm pretty gifted at that and um uh i wanna try some other mediums and uh let's see here i love fishing uh haven't gone in a while though and uh i like driving a truck you know uh it's you know my job you know i was a i really really enjoyed it i don't like driving through cities but uh usually when i'm in the middle of the night where i can see all the stars i like star gazing i'll see if i can um pick out some of those uh astronomy uh stars up up there and um  i'm a pretty easy going guy so shooting pool um sunshine just those i like uh most memorable experiences um good or bad uh most memorable experiences uh probably uh playing with lions and tigers uh uh wrestling a a baby elephant in a in a mud puddle uh uh just enjoying myself i know not uh i don't have much family as it is uh at least here in the states i don't my mom's from central america so uh  but i'm not close to i have uh  three brothers one sister and i'm probably not really really close to none of my siblings i speak with one brother uh quite a bit um my other youngest brother you know he he just i'd just rather not  you know i converse <con> converse with him but it's you know just i try to keep it on a professional basis my sister i don't talk to at all my my other brother underneath me i haven't spoken to him in years so i'm just close with my mom uh my niece some of my nephews and that's about it have i done anything to avoid it um to avoid them uh yeah i just don't talk to them i don't call them i don't ask about them i you know i talk to my mom quite a bit my brother quite a bit but i just don't bring up those subjects or if they are brought up i just usually say you know that's on them and i really don't wanna deal with them so um it's been hard lately it's been probably hard for the last uh going on a year um you know i uh depends on my thought process at the time i like i said i've been looking for work quite a bit um so just wondering why you know i don't get called i i just have my i have racing thoughts  so  or i get depressed you know 'cause i or i worry about things that you know that really i have no control over so i don't lately i just been sleeping a bit too much uh at least for me because i'm so used to just sleeping four to five hours a a a night but now it's changed to about eight to nine hours and i'm still tired uh lately i have been probably about the last few months um tired <laughter> um i you know if i don't sleep well sometimes then i just dwell back on the same things that have been bothering me so you know i'm more of a guy you know i love to work um and if i'm not then it's just a little bit too much time for me to spend in my own head and so you know um i there i either if i'm busy or i'm doing what i you know in whatever job i do i kinda you know get to it i enjoy it uh it's something new for me and uh so i can think about you know either work or i think of home and then think about this you know i don't have to worry about you know um money um you know bills are getting paid and i can just concentrate on other things either you know do the things i like or mm you know maybe spending a little bit more time with my girlfriend or you know so something like that  how do i what how do i cope with them um i just try not to think about it uh it's it's not about whether coping with it or not um i just do it's uh i'm more of a guy that just you know it may take me a moment to to um say that i'm coping with something but you know it it's if i have no control over it there's nothing that i can really do about it the only thing i can do is control to do what i'm doing and that's actively looking for work uh actively going out on uh  interviews uh talking with others about work so that i can just kinda you know get back to um back to basics you know i just don't let a lot of stuff bother me it does bother me but i try not to to let it continue to bother me if what has gotten me in trouble my mood swing i mean um yeah money i mean you know my past i i got a past history so uh which kinda tends to uh uh bother my uh my hiring process i don't know if i'm gonna get hired so i gotta deal with uh different different type of employers who are uh say uh felony friendly and uh uh stuff like that and i try you know i i've taken classes on uh  on uh how to interview how to uh how to answer some of the questions which you know come up quite a bit and uh i kinda reflect back on that but i just uh i gotta keep putting to my head that that's not who  who i wanna be anymore so or you know i i've done  uh i've done uh i've done my time uh so to say but uh i took the time you know the last time i just took a lot of time and  and try to uh work on the issues that were bothering me so um you know toward positive stuff i got my g_e_d different things a lot of classes um uh thought about going to school  i didn't go to school and uh anything that would kinda um change my old ways and and uh and try to move on to more productive activities  pardon me i still didn't hear you that people have been deceitful can you repeat that one more time alright uh i've been diagnosed with uh bipolarism um it's tough if you don't you know um i don't medicate so i mean i have been on medication before  in the past but <sniff> um again it's i try to live on life uh i try to live life on life's terms  and i just you know um i know the medical establishments always wanna label something and  and what i don't like about it is that they just experiment with pills you know i've been on probably every imaginable pill that there is for that and um you know some of them have been too strong or some of them not strong enough and so i just try to cope with things uh um it's just my life skills you know i i don't i don't wanna be using drug i know certain drugs work for like three to four months six months  and then they go well here i'm gonna try you on this and or i'm gonna try you on that  and it's just an ongoing process and i probably for about the last two years actually about three years i kinda just said you know what that's it and um whether it's different than whether if i would be on on on uhon meds for it   um i don't think so you know it's the still the same stuff i still get the same problems and i still  uh get the same anxiety as if i if i was on medication for it or not so i just and i'll deal with it you know sometimes it's not good you know i get irritated at people a lot i don't like people um i don't like crowds i don't you know like obnoxious people huge empty quiet so um but i i get a person you know i it's not that personality but i think people can see me and just say uh don't mess with this guy or you know um but still you know i like i i ride public transportation quite a bit and um you know you just get a lot of loud obnoxious people on there sometimes i gotta get off the bus that's how i deal with with with with people because i just know there's consequences if i if i didn't deal with it that way  so i just let it go i'd rather take the time on getting off the bus waiting for the next bus and hopefully it's not that bad  did i have a problem before i got out uh well i  i don't know if i knew that i had a problem um uh before i found out the thing is that i know other people  um i have a lot of ups and downs so i know a lot in my younger days people would tell me you know when i told them that i was diagnosed with you know bipolar that um  a lot of remarks were like oh that's what's wrong you know that's what was wrong with you we we wish that you would've would've found that out years ago  uh and uh like i don't think the meds really work but what i do uh i think uh time kinda like you know just getting older kind of uh you know makes it work you know me me dealing with life so pardon me uh i talked to a therapist probably on a weekly basis for a while uh recently and uh it helps a lot you know uh just to get out my anger uh my thoughts um a lot of people may not understand that but uh a therapist is i think the bigger thing is that i can just get it all out uh whatever's bothing me whether it be uh people you know uh uh other issues you know were whatever the case may be  i just think talking about it and they're such good listeners and can kinda like you know they they give me the same advice that you know that i you know give myself or whatever that i would give to others uh but it's always helpful if you hear it from somebody else somebody who will be has a you know are are you know they go to school for this so  you know but it's good to have yeah well i don't go anymore uh so um i kinda miss it you know like i said uh uh i miss it a lot actually but uh it's just one of those things you know i just deal with it you know uh according to you know if i ever get a chance to go to therapy again i probably will um well monetary reasons and uh you know uh i don't have health insurance there's a lot of things that you know i'd like to do but i can't you know um  you know money situation's not that great right now so how does my friends describe me um they would probably describe me as uh uh energetic uh outgoing person uh once i get to know people um laughs i you know i laugh a i laugh a lot um but uh they would probably tell you that i'm also very serious and uh  uh hidden person i don't reveal a lot you know and uh so  someone who has been a positive influence in my life someone who's been um someone who's been a positive influence in my life uh probably my boss one of my bosses uh when i first started with uh with exotic animals he was real you know he was uh uh german and um they didn't teach i don't know what he saw in me but he taught me a lot about working with exotic animals and um showed a lot of confidence in me and which in in it also built confidence in myself  and uh sort of let me know that you know that there's nothing that i really can't accomplish if i put my mind to it you know yeah it was you're welcome bye <laughter> 
yes it's okay <laughter> fine <laughter> i live in hollywood uh seattle <laughter> uh it's kind of a vague question um <laughter> just needed a change of scenery uh i like traveling by train it's not my favorite thing uh because i don't fly i i can't stand airplanes so i prefer trains yeah <laughter> uh what uh flying on an airplane <clears throat> mm probably december of nineteen eighty six or eighty seven <laughter>  <laughter> uh it's nothing uh much to tell really my usually i just go from l_a up to seattle then up to vancouver that's probably the main thing i do so took the train <laughter> uh not very often so once every five years or so so oh yeah sure absolutely yeah  uh depends on what it is that i'm annoyed by could be anything depends <laughter> it depends on whether it's uh a something or a someone you know eh if it's a someone i mean i'm i don't i don't uh i don't get physical towards them but i mean i've <clears throat> depends on what they've done to piss me off i mean i'm certainly not above uh shouting at them for whatever reason so just depends uh in terms of lashing out at other people physically i don't do that but in order to let off some aggressions if if need be i'll i'm not above you know punching a wall or punching something nearby i just i mean i'm not trying to you know just as long as it doesn't physically hurt me but but i i you know just get some steam let off let off some steam well that's normal for me uh <sigh> face to face uh <sigh>  mm can't remember it's been a long time eh but i mean eh but i argue about with people online about stupid shit yeah and that's that's normal shit but as far as like face to face you know it's been a long time and <clears throat> currently or or overall which one i mean someone i'm in contact with now or someone from maybe from my past or which is it <clears throat> <laughter> okay uh my mom had a uh uh a boyfriend when i was a teenager he was like a father figure when i was about fourteen so he was a pretty positive influence <laughter> not at all to uh open up a record shop yeah uh i'm an unemployed office worker right now <laughter> as in what doing what be more specific <laughter> <sigh> going on a first date with a a girlfriend back in uh two thousand seven when we first met uh <clears throat> just made arrangements to meet her and her daughter and her daughter's friends at the queen mary in long beach and uh you know i had to cement the evening to cement the day and evening together uh hanging out and eating dinner and just ate at their hotel and yeah just got to know each other that way so  yeah it was yeah uh well we were that was the beginning of a relationship at the same so that was that's how i knew her you know she was my girlfriend at the time so <laughter> so currently yeah i do yeah uh i don't it sucks balls i hate to have roommates it sucks <laughter> <laughter> god <laughter> mm in some ways it's okay 'cause they don't see me that much 'cause i'm not really around them and other times i i need i need to have my own space you know so uh it's difficult for me that way but we get uh get along but i i don't really see them that much and that's by design so  <cough> <sigh> uh <sigh> i like to be alone sometimes i read but just mainly i i just like to be alone maybe maybe just doing nothing so just depends no no <clears throat> no i'm sorry you repeat that no not necessarily <clears throat> very i'm a heavy sleeper <clears throat> i don't know that i would call it down but i'm not necessarily what you would call you know cheery but i don't know that i'm necessarily down yeah yeah all the time <sigh> uh mm it's hard to say i i don't know i uh i'm not sure <clears throat> mm i don't know that i'm really one <on> the one to ask you know i think you <laughter> have to ask someone else about that you know i have a difficult time answering that question  <laughter> most proud of uh that i didn't didn't fall into drugs like a lot of other other people that i know yeah hmm <clears throat> listening to music on vinyl being around dogs mm uh spent new year's eve with a friend real close friend so <laughter> not really <laughter>  <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> i'm glad i don't have any i think they're uh especially here in los angeles i i they drive me nuts i can't stand them <clears throat> uh i assume you mean post-high school um uh briefly just took basic uh what did i take uh just general studies i from what i remember i i i i actually didn't finish i quit to uh uh go play in a band so i i i skipped a lot of school so i didn't really <laughter> you know so nothing uh it was a junior college <coll> or community college so it was i didn't go to university so i was just do what stop going i just wasn't interested <laughter> my interests were elsewhere so i just i just quit going you know so in terms of what oh sure everyone has regret over something you know i'm i'm not gonna get specific but yeah sure i <laughter> there are things i regret sure <clears throat> mm twenty years ago what was that ninety three oh mm well ten years ago uh two thousand and three hmm it's hard to say it's hard to say gonna <go> have to have to come back to that one maybe oh i don't have a best friend these days <laughter> i think it depends on your definition of friend uh i don't uh <clears throat> i don't hang out with too many people you know i had <ha> i had best i had a so-called best friend you know but that was like no <laughter> twenty year twenty some odd years ago you know i don't really i'm very much a loner these days so i i don't really have what you would consider a best or really close friend you know eh i just don't have that <laughter> okay see ya <laughter> 
yes fine how about you here yes the weather weather mainly yeah the main <ma> the weather sorry not the people well some of the people stuff like that some people okay i'm cutting you off not as much as i used to um i used to be in school i used to travel a lot of places for conferences and things like that but i'm not in school right now but later on i'll get back into school and i'll travel more but right no doubt i don't i don't enjoy traveling uh that's a good question you're actually pretty good um i studied physics and aerospace engineering but physics mainly yes i am actually right now i teach community college physics and astronomy uh but i still do research in physics also because i like that type of thing and i'm going back to grad school hopefully that's why i'm nervous sometimes on the questionnaire impressive professor at a place like u_s_c or u_c or l_a or like that where the professors do three hours of work a week and the grad students do the rest you're actually pretty good at this <sigh> i there's a lot of people the the first one i guess is my physics teacher in a_p physics teacher in high school even though he led me to be an engineer instead of a physics major um he still was a very good influence he told me you know he's the first one who taught me that school was not about a grade but about learning okay i'm pretty good i think i'm single so i don't get in many arguments um but it's probably my brother about he always like to uh play a video game together i know i'm pretty old to play video games but they're actually pretty good um it's probably something like that and me getting angry at him and him trying to defend himself and me being right that's all fairly close um i see them pretty  pretty often parents i see a couple times a week they're getting older so i've been helping with groceries things like that and my brother i see  same same with him same amount <amo> same time my sister i tutor her kids my nephews uh so i see 'em about once a week also interesting yes because i spend long periods of time doing math and reading and not talking to anybody that's introverted i guess i play video games or and i work out i work out i think a lot i try to at least i roll my eyes which i've been told is a bad thing um and that's about it i think <deep breath> bad parenting basically parents are more self-centered more to themselves unlike previous generations and the kids just  do what they want because the parents aren't there for <fo> the parents aren't being parents in my personal <per> own personal opinion <sigh> um i guess scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry scrubbed_entry thank you i don't really have a best friend introverted remember i'm biased obviously but they are i'm really good in math i'm not really sure if you can't not saying you can't get better than me in math but thing is it's just that you get reach a certain confidence with it where no matter what it is you need to learn in math you can always figure it out um i am patient i think and i am disciplined where i can spend i can spend many hours many many many hours reading books that might not be important but they might be important so i have to do it anyway that type of thing when i a good workout  doing well in video games small little things like that um what's really happy is when my my research type thing mathematical or physics type thing when it goes well that must puts me in a mood <mo> that puts me in a good mood thank you right now it's the fact that research that i did i did make it this far research wise that's all that's all interesting um when you start off in school you read about einstein and things like that it's he's this general xxx hero particle physics and you have no idea what it is and you know it's very complicated things like quantum mechanics and you still haven't realized you're interested in that and but you're not sure if you can actually make it and eventually each step as a lot of time goes by you wish you as time goes on you can get closer and closer eventually make the goal eventually you realize you are just not as good as einstein but you are up there you can do research in physics you can add to mass knowledge in science and that's impressive that you you don't see yourself doing that when you're a kid okay um a few weeks ago when i got a good grade in a class thank you yes briefly  many years ago <ag> yes i don't know it just always growing up i always thought that was i always thought it was my dream when i was a kid that's why and i just went about doing that  um i was a national guard i think about eighteen nineteen i got commissioned at twenty twenty one and i was only in for about a year so i left at twenty twenty two yes not really i don't think it did i think it's just something that you grew up something about <abo> something i grew up already expecting to be so it didn't change me as much graduate school in physics no nope it depends if i workout really hard the night before <bef> the day the day before if workout pretty hard it's bad but if i don't workout it i don't know just eh it's hard i guess moderately  thank you yes it's okay i'm probably like i am now normal i think not as not as happy about everything  but still pretty okay i can still function no maybe slightly sorry no yes yes i have changes in my thoughts um applying to grad school again it's been awhile and slightly apprehensive happy that it's looks good but apprehensive that it might not be good and things like that what do you mean by that in case i know this is a computer but as in how hard is it to deal with these thoughts or how hard is it to go into grad school i understand okay i agree no not really probably keep doing what you're doing even though i'm not that old believe it or not um twenty years ago i was probably fifteen no no yeah yeah it was fifteen um just keep doing what you're doing i think i i was very lucky and fortunate way it worked out if i worked if it was a little bit different i don't think it'd worked out so well even though it's not perfect now i think i'm doing really well personally thank you same here goodbye 
sure uh okay i guess not bad not good so so denver colorado uh to pursue job opportunities uh about two years ago uh once or twice a year uh i really like the sunshine um all the opportunities all the different kinds of people lots of stuff to do that sort of thing uh i hate the traffic i wish the seasons were more distinct and that everything costs a lot of money here pretty easy hmm i'd say uh people are rude um not having enough money uh what else mm just a lot of things are frustrating i guess <cough> i guess it depends on  what i'm annoyed about like if it's at another person or about something i did or just life in general uh if somebody like a person annoys me i'll probably let them know they're annoying me until they stop is that what you're talking about okay uh so so not not as good as i'd like to be uh a few days ago about getting paid for something i did on time uh pretty pissed off taken advantage of i like to go to the gym uh hang out with friends read write that sort of thing mm at times uh because sometimes i like to keep to myself and don't feel like showing a lot of outward emotion i have a degree in in liberal arts majored in political science no i work uh in sales hmm to own uh several of my own businesses and and have lots of money coming in from different streams i guess if that's a job uh i used to live in mexico city that was pretty memorable um let's see it was pretty different than anything i've ever experienced it was a lot of fun exposed to a lot of new things and new people  uh i was pretty young carefree good times um not recently but i have in my life traveled quite a bit um let's see i went to london that was a lot of fun pretty cool city little too expensive but definitely cool of what just anything in life um let's see uh boy that's a good question um moving to l_a was pretty memorable took me a lot of hard work to uh move here so that was memorable i would say <sniffle> <clears throat> hmm uh maybe like six months ago uh things were just going really well didn't have much stress in my life uh yeah i'm i'm easier more easily irritated and uh yell more tired more uh kind of down feeling down more not as productive uh yeah awhile ago uh hmm mm don't know exactly it's been a few years but i still feel the same as i did when they diagnosed me so i assume i'm still depressed um well i just i'm a big believer in talking to people about your problems so i just thought that would uh be a good idea so i did it and and that's what i found out oh yeah definitely um i mean it depends on what you mean by therapy like i or most people probably can't afford good therapy but just even talking to friends i would consider therapy somebody who will listen so helps you get stuff off your chest  <clears throat> thanks um well i haven't necessarily seen a therapist per se but uh when you talk to somebody who listens and you and you get stuff like out there like out of your head or whatever it it's uh it helps to destress i think hmm pretty girls <laughter>  <laughter> um i'm a good leader i'm really smart uh being able to um survive on my own in a city like this completely on my own with no outside help  yeah lots of stuff um just dumb mistakes i made when i was younger that looking back now with what i know now i probably would not have made um i would tell myself to seek out and listen to people older than me as much as possible hmm scrubbed_entry he's always good for a sort of pep talk but uh with a dose of reality he doesn't sugarcoat anything so talking to him always helps give me perspective um talented and i don't know good at stuff i'm good at a lot of stuff people seem to notice that i i guess nice good disposition funny see you later 
alright yes okay and you inglewood california yes no uh it's okay um you mean my girlfriend and my daughter yes they're they're okay it's okay it's cool yes i do um well i'm a football recruiter so i travel uh all around the world to to sign different football players for our sports management company  uh um just the independence about it being alone being able to be free and not tied down to one to one thing you know it's great i i remember traveling to uh scrubbed_entry and take him to clubs and this and that and we're not that type of organization <laughter> yeah um dishonesty i <sigh> i don't like when people are are dishonest um that really really really bothers me and not true not honest not real um that that upsets me a lot um i tend to just try to free myself from the situation to clear my mind usually take a walk or something like that or just just just go in a room by myself and just try to clear my head <he> my head   um i'm okay with it at times um uh but i can defintely be better oh um i argued <argu> argued with my my lady a couple days ago and it was about um our daughter and some of the things she's doing in school and she she wants to raise her one way and i think i wanna raise her kind of a different way and discipline her a little more on certain situations so i think discipline <disci> discipline is a big key and the key is life and she she she was raised a little differently um i don't know just angry upset you know when you're in a argument that's what you feel so you do and say things that  that that bother you and you just you go on with it  um yeah uh a little bit <sigh> um i don't know it just <sigh> i eh just the way i feel i don't know i can't really say just the way i feel um a little a little um i don't know just um realness um honesty the truth just being straight out front um i'm pretty close um i'm pretty close with my family oh whole nother subject just they're raised different um i i think society <so> society's gonna become even wilder with <wi> the way the kids are raised and no discipline and and the things they're doing everything we we they live and everything's inflated so much to where um it it's getting to a point where it's getting out of hand i think kids these days to a certain extent are are are much wilder than i was and and generations before me and just able to do and say and the lack of respect and you know just education-wise it's just i think it's just tough times for kids and and the way they act uh it's it's it's ridiculous to me um i definitely like to watch sports uh i i like to gamble i i like to travel i like to skate um i like kind of like uh a a a guy that likes to see different sights and go different places uh like different <difft> i'm a big movie person so i like going to theatres stuff like that um i'm actually living it um i i always wanted to be in in some kinda sports industry and that's what i'm doing now i just uh my goal was to get a little higher in the ladder and and own my own sports management company um but i'm doing pretty well for myself so i am happy yeah no no no um it's okay i'd say it's pretty easy irritated tired <sigh> i don't know it's been awhile it's been awhile couple weeks ago huh what did you say no not really um i think he would describe me as a stand up guy i try to be um um a good loyal friend and and an adult i think he would describe me like that  uh school went to school grew up together i've been knowing all my friends for pretty much all my life  yeah uh very close me our our uh my friends and i are very close uh um we pretty much do a lot together still at this age  uh i'm honest um i'm loyal very loyal um i am a hard worker i think i am um to a certain extent i'm just not the average guy i'm pretty much i'm a different different breed i just carry myself and act a little different from a normal guy  i don't know just how what i was raised and how uh my dad was kinda different uh and and and he didn't go with the in crowd and i think i learned that from him a lot and and it's just it it's it's um kind of the same path i took um yes a lot of things i regret um i regret a lot of decisions in my life um yeah one um i actually let a a lady in my life go years ago that i thought was my soulmate and  we had a big argument and one thing led to another and we decided to take a break and then that that break i i started dating somebody else and i told her i'ma go my way and she go her way i think that was a big a bad decision a very bad decision yeah totally i think i could've took a step back and really just thought about the situation a little more instead of uh <sigh> being so upset and moving forward uh just upset um i tend to get upset and then my thoughts get clouded so uh mm i i need to think a little more when i'm upset uh i don't know just experience and time being you know making making up for your mistakes and and and and um being better about different decisions after you made the mistakes um <sigh> think a little harder about situations <situatio> uh about situations and and things and the decisions <dec> decisions that you make uh think a lot longer and harder before you make 'em and i think the outcome would been a little different today um my grandmother she's always been a um a a positive influence uh she's a great black woman um with a old school um ways of living so um i think i i i've added that to my life she's a great woman scrubbed_entry in baseball and um yeah <laughter> um i was a pretty good player i was a pretty good athlete growing up um i was one of the top scrubbed_entry and uh that started a future in in athletics and that's what i wanted to do so i accomplished my goals so at the time it was a great a great thing and it still is a great thing it's a great accomplishment in my life   um <sigh> accomplishments being able to if i or if i'm  have a goal or or something i'm supposed to do that week or that day and i accomplishment it always puts me in a good mood or getting my job done and i the way i'm supposed to do it in a in a timely fashion that always puts me in a good mood um being a positive role model right now um for younger kids that's in um our sports academy program i i think as i got older the thought process and um the way i look at life has totally changed and i think i a lot of kids can look up to me that i deal with now and say you know that's somebody that that is is a positive <po> a positive influence in my life oh um couple days ago my football team um we're in the playoffs made the playoffs so that always makes me happy thank you thank you bye bye

friend of mine was um you know making a lot of money in stocks and um you know i was um first i used to uh uh you know interact with him uh well also be with him when he was trading stocks and i realized he was uh making a lot of money then i uh did a formal course in it uh attended lot of seminars then you know um lost <lo> lost <lo> lost a lot of money and uh before i started making money

know i'm very good at controlling uh my temper the last time i argued with was with my brother it was about my dad um you know uh he was getting old uh i mean he's getting old and um he lives in india and uh i was planning on uh bringing him here my dad's um i mean my brother said it's gonna be very expensive to um you know it's gonna be very expensive uh with respect to health bills and uh i was uh you know arguing with him that we should all pool in the money and get them here because they are quite old i have a mom too you know pool some they're both old i'm very close to my parents not so close to <t> uh um with my brother and their family um it's the i mean like i tend to be judgmental and uh you know but i think sometimes that the my niece and nephew should have been brought brought up in a different way and uh you know uh and you know my <m> my brother doesn't seem to uh think along the same lines and um you know uh we have disagreements and mm you know that's the reason it is um no not at this time what do i think of what um can you can you repeat that one more time um and i still couldn't follow you okay no no uh yes about <bout> one to two years ago i was feeling down <d> uh down and i was not interested in things that i was <wa> that i was normally interested in  and uh you know i was sort of withdrawn and um the it was sh i was not able to focus on my things so i thought maybe i should go see a doctor and i ended up doing that uh no mm xxx i lost appetite i was not sleeping well and i i had difficulty um concentrating you know and focusing and uh i was not getting uh my assignments done on time uh these <the> these were some of the problems i been feeling good but uh no i don't i started doing yoga and uh you know i've been doing that for about a year and that's uh and meditation and that's helped a lot uh it's just that uh you know when i was diagnosed with uh depression i thought i shouldn't be taking any medication for it and i was looking at uh uh other ways to get over the problem and uh then i realized some of my friends were doing meditation and uh you know i got influenced by them uh it's a little difficult but uh of late i've been able to sleep uh within half an hour  there are days when it takes almost one two hours to uh go to sleep are they what can you repeat that uh no i just uh you know uh just switch off the light and uh you know keep tossing around and uh try to focus on things uh that makes me uh feel good and this and that um about <bout> three days ago what am i proud of uh i was in i i was among the top two percent in my m_b_a class and um and when i used to run my business i designed a product um that was uh working really well and uh i was happy that i was able to design something that was so useful for my business uh my my i'm thinking my friends would describe me as uh very friendly very easy to get along with  uh very focused uh very intelligent  and a good cook um albert einstein uh i mean some <so> some of some of some of his theories um you know it obviously it involves <inv> it involves a lot of deep thinking and uh the the first few times i read about him about his uh uh theories uh i had difficulty in um um really understanding that and uh that you know we it i mean when's when there when there are things that i really try to understand and i i'm not able to i and uh you know there are there are the type of people i admire listen to other people uh it's diverse um and i like the the entertainment industry  and uh i like uh yeah the fact that there are more women uh than men here <laughter> um uh there are certain areas where only spanish <spa> uh where only spanish is spoken uh you know i would like uh for all people who come to america to be able to understand english and be able to speak in english  so that everybody can participate um in l_a um i mean like i some of the things the political leaders uh do really makes me mad uh uh sometimes i think they're wasting their wasting their time our time and other countries are advancing  and um you know these <th> these guys don't get things done and you know i feel very bad about it and sometimes it makes me angry uh yeah i mean the first four years of uh obama administration i'd i think it was wasted because uh if the if congress had acted together uh eh got things done then uh you know we would <wou> mm maybe we could have uh you know uh made it much more difficult for china to catch up with us and you know the fact that china's able to do things and get things done much faster and these people still um you know uh argue and uh you know find <fi> uh find faults with each other and not get things done um you know they don't seem to realize that you know uh you know the clock keeps ticking you know they have to get things done um i mean like you know uh <laughter> one thing that comes to my mind is well you know i made a lot of money while uh you know once in los angeles uh and you know i thought it happened during christmas some ten years ago and uh that that made me very happy good music good food uh i mean the eh a party with friends that i like and uh and you know i also like cooking and i enjoy cooking with groups in groups uh those are things that really put me in a good mood um i'm very clean um i listen to people and i empathize uh try to solve their problems uh and i'm hoping they

yes um i'm fine this is a little bit strange you know talking to a virtual human um i was born i was born in l_a i was raised out in the suburbs um i've lived all over los angeles i've lived in the valley long beach and now i'm in culver city um there's great food here the weather is great most of the time there's a lot of sunshine it doesn't get cold i don't have to shovel snow there are lots of opportunities a lot of diversity all different sorts of people uh i think that's really great  that is a much longer list i would like to get out of here um the the traffic i think that's number one i think everybody hates the traffic and everybody's so busy all the time it's really hard to to get together with anybody everybody's so devoted to their jobs and uh then we're sitting in traffic a lot too  i just graduated actually um i studied marine biology i was i went to school and i orginally studied um graphic design and i found that kind of unfulfilling so i took a trip for a while traveled around the world and started scuba diving and i realized that i really loved marine biology so that's how i got into it  everybody's been asking me that a lot lately since i just graduated i think i would like to <exhaling>  um i think maybe managing a um managing a research you know i'm not i'm not really sure i think i would like to something in tropical marine ecology maybe like managing a preserve um something like that it's a hard question to answer <laughter> i do um i like meeting new people and seeing different parts of the world well i traveled for eight months in central america um and i visited a lot of different countries i um i went scuba diving i think um i think intolerance injustice in the world those are probably the things that get me the most fired up vent to my boyfriend does that count <laughter> i'm pretty good it takes it takes a lot to really get me um fired up to the point where i i kinda blow my top the very few people that have seen me angry um to the point where i'm kind of yelling and screaming angry um i don't know i just don't get there i think that i'm a little bit afraid of losing my temper so i keep it under control  <laughter> it was yesterday actually i argued with my boyfriend um about uh getting getting a job i was talking about taking a job somewhere and he was being very supportive and i really wanted him to to say no don't go take that job for six months 'cause i would miss you and he was just being supportive so um we kind of argued about that <laughter> and it was ridiculous so we i ended up laughing and that was the end of the fight um meditate excercise go out in nature just um unplug get myself away from the computer away from technology away from people  i would say not really um i'm an only child and it's just me and my parents and we're very very dissimilar for example um i'm a pretty adventurous person and i like learning and my parents are uh couch potatoes they like to watch reality television so we don't have too much to talk about or things that we can really do um as far as shared activites so you know i love them and everything but there's not too much common ground yes i think i'm a very social introvert but i seem to find most social encounters to be draining where as my my boyfriend for example he um derives a lot of pleasure and energy from being around people for me it's always a little bit the opposite i have to recharge  i not sure i have a best friend but um i guess i'll say my boyfriend he's he's kinda my default best friend um he would probably say passionate intelligent um he always tells me that i'm really hard on myself which is true um dedicated loyal   i think i'm just proud of who i am xxx i don't know if that's the answer that most people give but i think that i'm i'm really proud of who i am i try really hard um i've done a lot of things in my life i'm a really good person i think it's it's kind of rare to find people that are kind and i consider myself  a kind person that that cares about others and wants to make the world a better place so i'm i'm proud of that <laughter> no i have not no yes i was probably about fifteen at the time so i think eight was is that seventeen years ago  yes um i was cutting and my one of my best friends called um called my parents and let them know and at that point they took me in for treatment i that wasn't the first time i had ever been to a therapist or a psychiatrist but um before it was more they thought i had a_d_h_d so um it was more <m> i think my parents really took me in rather than me seeking help i haven't for about three years uh i stopped because it felt like uh i was checking in with a parole officer i just wasn't enjoying the relationship i had but i still have the psychiatrist that i go to for med checks  <laughter> uh i do think it's useful if you have the right therapist i think if you don't have a good relationship with your therapist it can be incredibly harmful i have talked to people that have had bad experiences and and won't ever go back lately i've been a little bit down um i should say a little bit more down than usual because i graduated and my routine of go to school and do school things twenty four seven has come to an end and without the routine it's been a little bit  weird finding out what to do with my finding a way to be productive and knowing what to do with my time it's also been a little bit um depressing finding out that my intelligence and good grades in school doesn't translate to real world skills and there aren't that many jobs for marine biologists in california  almost impossible ever since i was a little kid i had a i had trouble falling asleep and um about four years ago it it became really really bad where i just couldn't sleep through the night i was getting about four hours of sleep  sometimes i would wake up every hour and i'd wake up in the morning just a complete wreck so for about four years i've been taking trazadone so i can sleep um have you ever seen fight club um you're a virtual human so you probably haven't seen that but it's it's pretty much like that i i'm just um a complete panicked anxious wreck i i lose my ability to deal with um i lose my ability to deal with things i'm much more likely to lose my temper um i can't regulate my moods i'm just really volatile probably a few months ago i think that i may have been on a trip gone away for a weekend and forgotten to take my medicine with me um or something like that and then i can't sleep and so that's what happens   uh <makes sound with mouth> really happy i mean um i don't know it's easy for me easier for me to keep track of when i feel really really bad really happy i guess i felt happy on new year's really happy on new year's eve which was um uh ten days ago um i was with my boyfriend and some friends and we took a trip out to palm spring and joshua tree and it was really nice to see them i don't get to see them very often um because i've been in school and i've been so busy so it was really nice reintroduction to uh real life i think that i'm i'm kind i'm considerate i'm tolerant i'm pretty open minded i'm aware of my faults um i just i just try to be nice to everybody and i'm very curious about um about the world and things that i don't know about i really like to learn  uh off the top of my head first thing that came comes to mind is diving the blue whole in belize it was really amazing um it was me and my friends we just you know jumped off the boat and you come up over the edge of this uh limestone sink hole and it's really really really blue and you just drop down to about a hundred and forty feet in something like two minutes we did it pretty quick not everybody could do it that quick and um as you go down you see all these stalagmites and stalactites and they're huge they're larger than human and 'cause it's this  cave system um and it's really murky and there's sharks swimming all around you so  that was that was pretty good <laughter>  i'm trying to remember that at the moment i haven't had much free time the last three and a half years being in school um

yes <laughter>  fine how are you uh watts california but now i live in west l_a  <laughter> yes i love uh the sunshine i love the palm trees i love that um you're thirty minutes away from everything it's a great city   the traffic it's terrible  i studied child development  yeah actually i uh teach children how to be safe in uh traffic situations  oh my dream job is to be a filmmaker that's what i wanna do i wanna die doing that job making movies  well when i was uh in high school i did a lot of drama theater productions and i just love everything about film so once i had the opportunity to actually make a film uh because i wasn't getting any work as an actor i just got hooked i just love making film <laughter>  last time i made a film just this last october made a short film  <laughter> it's about three people that connect together they're completely unrelated but they get to a retreat where they realize that their problems are bigger than what they imagined originally thanks <laughter>  really mad uh  <laughter> really mad i you know i guess what makes me really mad is when my daughter acts stupid at school when she does not do her work and uh when she doesn't pay attention and i have to get phone calls home and letters home and emergency parent conferences that's what makes me mad  yeah  <laughter> yeah yeah it sucks she's one of the smartest kids in her school  no it's it's it's very difficult because a lot of things in yourself that you find are negative go to them and it's like you're fighting against yourself trying to change yourself but you know that little person is you you know times a hundred and it's just difficult to deal with that but um other than that it it's okay but it's being a parent is never easy   <sigh>  the hardest thing about being a parent  i would say is trying to give that little person so much life experience so that they don't make mistakes or so that they don't get hurt and you wanna give it to them and you want them to just accept it right away but then they don't so it gets very uh  um annoying sometimes that you know what's coming and you give them the info and they don't wanna take it they wanna find their own way and to watch them get hurt it's it's sad and then they wanna come to you and you're like ugh i tried to tell you but you can't be mad at them because everybody learns their own way so    mm yeah i guess for a while when when you think about it uh when you watch them go through their struggles it's hard to watch but it's a necessary motion of life children have to learn the way they wanna learn 'cause once they get it they got it so however they get it you as a parent you're happy they got it  <sigh> all the love the children bestow upon you it's great they  yeah they love <lo> you know love you and all especially my daughter she always wants to give me hugs she always wants to talk to me she always wants to be around me uh she always tells me i'm doing a great job when i'm like <laughter> what does she know about a great job she's only seven but you know they have that unconditional love and you just can't help but feel like a good person for having the children tell you that you're a good person so i like that  hmm oh <laughter> my god they're ooh <sigh> they're you know it like albert einstein said it best that our technology has exceeded our humanity and there's so much technology out there kids are learning so fast it's almost like they're already little adults but they're missing the steps to being a child they miss going outside they miss learning about things naturally rather than just going to youtube or you know wherever facebook and and getting it so fast and they don't know what to do with all this information and they just have to fight through all that info and they the it's not organic anymore children growing up these days it's not organic it's sped up it's pushed and it's just so hard for them to figure out who they are in this world so that's what's wrong hmm me <laughter> just <sharp inhale> breathe in <sharp exhale> and breathe out or i'll just walk away from the situation  argued  i argued with my fiancee uh a couple months ago about gosh i forgot i i forgot i don't remember  it was petty yeah but it didn't last long 'cause she's like me she doesn't like to argue about stuff we like to take care of stuff as it happens and that's it hmm my fiancee <laughter> well um well i mean we met um when i was working at at a charter <ch> not a charter school but at a recreational center we met there and uh we talked we hit it off uh we didn't see each other for an entire year and then uh we reconnected and we went on a date and it was great ever since my family we're pretty close my brother lives in colorado my sister lives in oklahoma i have a dad that lives in a neighboring city where i am um as close as we can be with the distance and certain choices that my family have made over the years you know being far away and um but my immediate family like you know my fiancee and my daughter like we're close and it's great <laughter> i don't travel enough but i have traveled a couple of times uh within the last five years i just came back from new zealand so that was a great experience  yeah  i enjoy meeting new people that's the biggest thing about traveling i like seeing new things i like just immersing myself in different cultures and situations and i like just being away from it all that's that's good too well i went to new zealand uh not too long ago and i had <ha> stayed there for a week um i learned about celsius 'cause you know here we have fahrenheit and that was fun uh i learned how to play cricket   uh i learned how to get myself out of a capsized kayak and um i learned that they have a lot of lamb lamb is good i like lamb but they had a lot of lamb oh and their seafood <seaf> seafood i can't eat but they do have really great chocolate chocolate is <sigh> it was so good and ice cream was good too and uh the people were really really nice they it was a very special time for me to go there it was great and they accepted me i love that and yeah can't wait to go back  <laughter> yes it was some of my best qualities um energetic uh very personable uh intelligent i am easy to get along with i work pretty hard and i'm very slow to getting upset about things  no  no no mm it's fairly easy  <laughter> uh i guess i get pretty moody you know i could be a little little snappy at people when i don't sleep well when i have lack of sleep but once i get some sleep in me i'm okay mm fine  no no no changes no scrubbed_entry um you know he would say that i'm pretty funny um lax about a lot of things uh i enjoy life as much as i possibly can um good friend to have around and always ready and eager to help <laughter> just waking up in the morning <laughter> it's always a great thing uh i love ice cream that's always good i love laughing ugh if somebody's laughing especially my fiancee 'cause she has a great laugh then that puts me in a good mood hmm thank you  scrubbed_entry and that's what i wanna do i definitely wanna get into acting and really work it and get some really good roles so he's been a positive influence he stayed out of trouble um he's maintained a good working relationship with people and he's always positive and very super helpful and very encouraging      oh we went to junior high school and high school together so he's my best friend  yeah  <laughter> yes it is  wow there's so many uh  scrubbed_entry had uh these bag of m and m's and we had went to a play and there were two girls that were a couple of rows down that you know we didn't particularly care for but you know that's how kids are you just they don't know how to you know they say they don't like somebody but you know anyway but we got these m and m's and while the it was dark we start throwing m and m's and hitting 'em in the head with the m and m's and then we came to school like three days later uh we were summoned and there was a mock trial to get scrubbed_entry so we were able to get ourselves off on like the entire group had found us not guilty of the crime and but then we got in trouble anyway because our teacher just wouldn't allow us to not get in trouble so we had to clean up the yard for like two days  oh man you name it uh i love scuba diving i've only done it twice but i love it wanna get back into it like traveling uh i love exercising i actually like working out now uh i used to think it was a chore but now i'm really really getting into it that i love watching movies you put me in front of a good movie and i'm a happy camper so that's about it hanging out with family  anything i regret hmm <deep breath> you know what i think i <laughter> i probably regret not going up to will smith when i had the chance  yeah uh will smith was coming up the street and i saw him and i got so nervous i jumped in the bushes and i didn't meet him uh my boss at the time thought it was really funny but i just i wasn't ready to meet him yet so but i think i regret meeting him   advice i would give myself ten or twenty years ago i would probably say that when my gut told me to do something i should've just went on ahead and did it rather than sit and analyze it you know days weeks months later if i feel it in my gut i should go for it so go with my gut more  really happy  hmm really happy i i had a film festival that i was putting together and things were so intense we things were going wrong but then things were going right but then once the people came and packed the house i was really happy that we had a packed house at this uh film festival so this was about a month ago  yeah  <sigh> let's see i think right now at this point i'm most proud of putting a short film together with a minimal budget but it has amazing actors it has a great storyline and i didn't think it could be done but it's done or close to being done and i'm i'm proud of that i was able to get it done i think i could walk away happy knowing that i gave it a really good shot and i think this movie is probably going to take me and the rest of my film crew buddies to higher heights oh really  alright well what was your name again  ah ellie  goodbye  
<laughter> yes i'm okay with this very good l_a it's sunny and uh it's near the ocean <sigh> uh the traffic can make it difficult to drive around between different places and there's a lack of uh uh open uh spaces if you're not near a beach uh no um i uh i haven't planned on haven't finalized any travel plans listen to music yeah um uh well i tend to excel at things that  have to do with um uh spending time alone versus things that have to do with uh spending time outside with uh lots of people i'm reasonable mm maybe maybe yesterday i was trying to figure out how to stuff <stu> pack something into the car i'm very good at it <deep breath> i breathe in and out <sigh> like that <sigh> uh like jogging walking bicycling reading <sigh> listening to music uh math engineering computers uh a little bit yeah um i'm a student i'm going back to school for uh biological sciences um <sigh> started doing some reading on um some textbooks dream job um <sigh>  medical doctor uh it's i guess it depends on the type of medicine you practice <laughter> uh i have a mentor yeah i have a mentor who has a lot of positive um thoughts and um suggestions i uh through a professional so i met someone through a class and then they worked with them professionally so it's i guess you could say through an academic or professional channel <sigh> hmm mm <sigh> uh let's see one of my most memorable i can't think of one at the moment no no i don't think so no <sigh> takes me a little while to fall asleep but once i'm asleep it's it's reasonably okay uh i think i'm a little forgetful and nervous no sometimes mm what do you wanna know mm <sigh> well um i think sometimes i do think about  challenges ahead of me and uh that can be a little daunting and i i feel down it is very hard go for a walk read a book listen to some music um <sigh> i don't i mean i'm sure they are i'm not specifically sure what triggers anything uh maybe feeling overwhelmed or uh not feeling particularly tied to some task i don't go to a therapist um reasonably smart inquisitive <inqui> inquisitive and curious mm i guess through classes uh <sigh> somewhat mm patience and curiosity uh <sigh> enjoyed hmm mm think i went on a walk at night uh a day ago no can you repeat that can you rephrase that uh i think they're lucky very lucky got everything in front of 'em yeah uh <sigh> most proud of <deep breath> <sigh> maybe academic achievements uh i guess just the time i've spent studying math and science um hmm mm mm i'm not sure 
yes very well  new york  just turn the volume up a little bit  <laughter> uh for a change yeah it's good  i wanted <wa> i wanted to i wanted to see what los angeles was about  um probably took a year or two  uh you know being away from my family being away from what i was used to in new york the neighborhoods the people and just getting acclimated to a whole new lifestyle here uh the weather  you can't beat the weather it's generally always nice it's not too hot it's not too cold uh it's creative i do like uh you know movies  uh like the beach  the traffic it's a lot of traffic uh  some of the sometimes i think people are a little bit colder here than and more distant and unfriendly than other places  i was a history major  no uh i do uh demonstrations in really <rea> uh high-end supermarkets uh to be a screenwriter  that's one of the reasons why i came to los angeles  um it's hard 'cause i don't always maintain uh focus and motivation i let other things distract me <laughter>  uh i was uh i've always been interested in films ever since i was a child and i was just always you know was writing and had an active imagination   uh i've in the last probably almost ten years i've traveled more than i had in the past <pa> well i've always traveled even as a kid my parents would travel around so yes seeing new places and seeing uh people that are different than i am seeing how they live  and taking in the sights  uh i went to kenya that was probably one of the best trips i ever went on um on the safari and   just going out in a jeep and seeing <laughter> wild animals in their own natural habitat was pretty incredible   oh yeah that's one the great experiences of my life and i also got to uh  a a place in egypt uh at the end of that trip um called uh  sharm el sheikh which is right on the water and it has some of the best scuba diving in the world which is hard to believe that egypt would but it was just amazing i went <we> i didn't go scuba diving i went uh snorkeling  what do i do to relax uh i i do i like to listen to music i like to uh helping watching movies helps me relax 'cause it takes me out of you know whatever might be on my mind i do meditate every day um i like to take walks in nature that's always calming especially down by the uh the ocean  uh what i it depends <laughter> sometimes i get angry and lose my temper uh a lot of times uh  i'll do like a form of self-hypnosis and calm myself which is something i've recently learned how to do  which is very helpful  and also since i meditate it doesn't i don't get annoyed at things as easily as i did in the past some things that makes me really mad  i guess uh think of injustice  in the world or done to people when uh it doesn't really need to be that way that we could all get along  um  and and make the world better <laughter> uh last night i went to a movie screening  of a independent film and i didn't think it was done very well it's not so much that we had a fun argument  about uh about the movie  so that was like you know that just happened yesterday so that was that's on my mind  <laughter> is there anything i regret yeah there's there are have been opportunities in my life that i wished i had uh taken them and pursued them  uh certain jobs you know when i first got to los angeles i had an opportunity to uh  become a grip and uh and i i probably should've pursued that  how did i decide it to do that i don't really understand the questions take advantage of every opportunity that came my way  to always <alway> i think saying yes  uh to any opportunity is is very important and no matter   how you feel you know you have to be confident that you'll be able to achieve what you wanna do  no no no but i've been depressed in my life  uh for the most part i've i've been feeling good sometimes uh i feel a little blue uh i think you know sometimes if i if i allow <allo> allow a regret to come into my mind that can bring me down but i can you know usually get out if it pretty quickly  uh sometimes financial concerns sometimes uh  an an opportunity um how do i explain it eh there  sometimes <so> sometimes <someti> eh financial is one way i that i if i had made another decision i might have more money or my life would be different  um  not really i mean i i feel  pretty much the same what got me to seek help for <laughter> let's come back to that  um i've well okay well it generally talking to someone has helped when i did do that  uh pretty easy i don't have a problem sleeping  uh  usually i'm grumpy <laughter> so if i don't sleep well uh you know i feel tired and irritable   uh  how would my best friend describe me that's a good question um friendly <f> well i'm friendly <f> i'm definitely friendly and outgoing uh little bit secretive um i would probably that i should be they'd like to see me more accomplished and uh and uh attaining my goals and happier <ha> maybe a little happier   i think um  it it it's tough it depends sometimes i'm very introverted 'cause i do like to write so that takes it means that i have to spend time alone and then when i come out of that uh i'm extroverted so i don't really see myself with as one hard way or the other it all depends on my on the situation and my mood  my best qualities um i think i'm caring i think i'm intelligent  uh i think i'm funny i'm outgoing um i have a likeable personality  you know people have said that  um i'm engaging but not uh oppressive or overly engaging there's a sort of a cool detachment  um and creative intuitive  <laughter> yes <laughter>  last time i felt really happy  i don't know i woke up this morning i was pretty happy  i had breakfast i was happy  sun was shining  <laughter>  um  i think that like i said going to kenya  was a memorable experience i do remember <remem> scuba uh snorkeling was a really great experience <ex> experience i just remembered you know seeing all the colors in the ocean  you know and feeling the sun powerful sun on my back  um almost beyond you know because <beca> almost beyond like   human in a way just more in touch with like everything the universe yeah it would be nice to feel that way every moment of the day but  what am i most proud of in my life  i think i've uh helped <pft> people  uh and sometimes when they were in crisis um you know i've written some screenplays <scr> screenplays um  i've had some good relationships  um good relationships just you know being connected with someone else you know  spending time with them and connecting  on emotional and  <laughter> physical and  mental levels  um what it could be a song that i hear on the radio uh it could be uh lot of times looking forward to something you know if i'm gonna go to a movie go bowling hang out with people um

hello sure good a little tired indianapolis indiana  uh i'm a singer i like singing  um diversity my girlfriend's uh from taiwan so it's dealing with different cultures  the traffic the uh crazy people it's um  seems hard to get anything really accomplished <laughter> it took me about six months just to figure out the directions twenty eight years ago a long time haven't been there in about eight or ten years well uh i don't like my brothers so i don't want to hang around them i started my girlfriend uh we did about uh just went back got back from orlando and uh she likes to travel so meeting new people seeing new places uh helps me to get out of l_a and get a different perspective uh i just did the avatar seminar which is like a raise your consciousness and um cleaned out the crap in your head  <laughter> um yeah i feel better uh been having a lot of psychic attack and it's uh i'm psychic so it's very hard to deal with it  <laughter> um well um there's more to life than what you see so um a lot of things are in other dimensions and other places so have to deal with not only the emotions but people uh direct energy at you um well have to do a lot of clearing and grounding and stay true to yourself i am both well i'm introverted because i like to spend time by myself and i'm extroverted 'cause i like to meet new people uh used to be totally an introvert  watch movies watch t_v read uh do crosswords i'm a singer sing write music i'm writing a novel um it's sort of like the matrix um well i wrote the first twenty pages pretty quick so um uh now i'm expanding it i get inspiration uh it was actually a dream and then i wrote down the dream and now it's becoming uh i could probably turn it into a movie <laughter> yeah uh when people don't respect me that's the number one no i just that my brothers they don't respect me they don't really um you know i want to love my family and but i don't want to hang around my brothers so it's a conflict exactly pretty good i only get mad about once a year um my girlfriend about two or three months ago she was wanting me to do something and i said no <yawn> and i don't know yeah she's my girlfriend i know her for about a year now pretty close um one time i was singing and scrubbed_entry and i was singing to an audience and that was great um well i'm looking into ways to expand my consciousness so that i can have more money and more abundance in my life so i can uh have my own house and uh live in my own creative space  <sniffle> uh singing i'm a singer so let's see like unforgettable so uh that's what i like to do no no no oh that's the hard part i uh i don't  i don't know maybe it's because when i was uh a kid my brothers beat me up and i don't feel totally rested in myself or in my life so uh i feel like uh <sniffle> i don't feel totally safe yeah um a little irritable but i have been sleeping better since i met my girlfriend so it's not totally bad my what behavior what i don't know um well i feel more positive i did the seminar and uh so that let me get rid of some crap in my brain <sniffle> and be more positive about life um well did a lot of exercises to uh reduce my stress and lot of my stress comes from uh judging myself and other people  yeah you could say that <laughter> uh well <sniffle> mm mm i don't know it's hard <yawn> hard to deal with sometimes i mean sometimes a lot much too critical for my own good uh <sniffle>  well watching t_v gets up but <yawn> uh lately i just been feeling like i need to um have less judgement and more fun  uh well i did that seminar um it was about a week ago i think  uh well i went to that seminar i got there i was able to take off work and <yawn> <sniffle> be in a different environment 'cause my job is stressful and <sniffle> my life is stressful so uh <sniffle> i was able to take a break which is great uh i'd say i'm outgoing fun smart uh but i mean in l_a people in l_a they don't want to most of them don't want to spend time with you i don't know if that's because of me or l_a <laughter> uh that i spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward avoid it yeah watching t_v or going to see movies or <sniffle> trying not to think of it but it doesn't solve the problem uh well a little bit i haven't paid my bills a lot i still owe money <sniffle> so um it's kind of a self-defeating prophecy <proph> prophecy  uh stop criticizing and start creating your future now instead of waiting for it to happen  uh my girlfriend's been really helpful <yawn> well she's funny and <sniffle> she loves me and cares about <abo> about me and  uh <laughter> yeah um singer and i'm intelligent and creative and multi-dimensional and uh i'm a good listener  uh well i've written about four or five books i uh my voice i think would be number one 'cause when i started i didn't have much of a singing voice but now i do okay bye bye 
yes  i'm doing fine  i'm from los angeles california  wow wonderful weather um outdoor activities all the time too crowded pollution  the norm  i studied child communications um recently i just i would say yes preschool teacher  well i've always worked with children ever since i was eighteen years old so i figured doing something helping someone it doesn't pay well but you're investing in the future  wow some job that i could get paid to be outside all day get paid well to be outside all day  yes  i'm kinda quiet but i also like i probably would say borderline i like outside activities but i mainly kinda do um activities probably by myself so yeah i would say i'm an introvert slightly uh wow just um maybe a racist or disrespectful person i kinda shut down and and reevaluate how i am as a person how i'm coming off to other people i can't change anyone else's personality but i can work on my own   i'm pretty good  i usually don't argue with people i usually walk away i mean a argument doesn't settle anything  wow it's a lot of things i regret but it's not anything that i can control probably the biggest regret was losing my mother  thank you  i was extremely close to my mother that was who i am as a person who made me as a person  wow twenty ten years ago i would tell myself not to be so angry so  upset all the time about things i can't control i would tell myself to relax and not be so hard on myself  i think that's pretty cool i think you should have different avenues to deal with different people   <clears throat> no i have not  no i have not  yes  um less than a month  i realized i have to evaluate myself as a person so i can't really look to anyone else to help me unless i i start with myself no i don't  i feel like as a person as uh a individual i feel like i should be able to control things myself i feel like to go seek out help is good for someone else it probably is very good for other people i've worked with that population of p_t_s_d um veterans before so i know that it helps a lot of people but i don't feel like it's for me it's not difficult at all i've always been like a loner someone who who tries to handle <ha> to handle my own problems and situations  a little depressed but i think everyone is it has a little bit of sadness in them at some point   day by day day by day i just started a exercise program so i'm trying to look at myself  for the solution  always known ever since i was a child things moved me differently than other kids so i felt like i was always different i felt like if i was gonna ever understand me as a person then i would have to work on myself so yes  um today i got to see my best friend after a long time so i mean happiness comes and goes but i felt happy today  wow he would say really silly um  but still when i'm around him i try to be happy i try to present a a a situation where we're both gonna be happy no one wants to be around a depressed person  scrubbed_entry wow i mean on certain days everything could be my best quality but i would say um i'm loyal i'm dependable um  i would just say i try to be there in the moment i'm not a person who who is really fat flashy <f> excuse me uh flashy or into materialistic things so i feel like i'm very grounded  oh my mother by far my sisters  uh my mom was a school teacher which made me wanna become a school teacher and that's basically what i have been doing uh my sister has been at her job for forty years so i've always had a stable influence in my life  wow i would say just sitting on a sunny nice day talking to my mother i would say that would bring a smile to my face immediately   wonderful  wonderful  i like to get out and play sports i play four or five different sports and um i like to go for a walk i like to ride my bike i like to get out and be active  having such a wonderful mother i mean i have to keep going back to that subject because we're introduced into this life and that's our first teacher that's our first teacher and it's gonna be our teacher for a very long time and uh i'm just very thankful i'm very proud to have had such a wonderful woman as my mother riding my bike simple things going for a walk with my sister exercising  uh just last sunday  well thank you  
yes um i'm okay i was born in san bernardino california  yes um i'm staying with a sister in north hollywood um she makes it as comfortable as possible uh i love the weather and the entertainment and the public transportation um it's very difficult to find full time employment  and some of the people aren't as friendly as people from the south 'cause i lived in the south before um those are the only two things no i don't i was an english major in college i haven't finished yes i am um i'd like to be a recording singer yes um i've always loved to sing from the time that i was a child  at times um when i'm alone i am um extremely <sigh> i guess i would say um inter minded like i um have a lot of thoughts and i keep them to myself <clears throat>  so if i'm in that mode then i don't really um interact with people but i can also interact with people if i change modes um i just started doing yoga a couple of weeks ago and last week on thursday no on tuesday um  usually i just try to um remain quiet and listen to the situation if it's a person or if it's a situation <clears throat> that i'm dealing with myself that's annoying i try to um think of alternate ways that would make the situation better  um come up with alternate plans so i won't get annoyed um pretty good um mm i may have had an argument a few weeks ago um just about timeliness like meeting on time and showing up on time and it was actually last um monday yeah mhm no um to just be cautious of people's intentions and to listen really well 'cause people usually tell you what their intentions are without even um realizing <re> realizing it  um a good listener patient um fun loving generous um depressed sometimes um  but generally a good person no i have not yes um within a year and a half ago um i just knew that i often thought about situations that um happened in the past and kinda blamed the situation for my future and um um certain settings um if i  um see certain types of individuals in certain settings it just reminds me of when i was younger when things happened and changed my future plans so i um try to i used to just try to avoid those types of situations and certain types of people at that time but now i feel like i um just handle things better as far as um being in the similar settings with similar people i just i um handle those things better i do um i like to believe that it does i don't worry as much um it's just allowed me to know that actually speaking about the issues um relieves me of the tension of um holding them inside so that's how it's helped me at first it was difficult just being open with my internal emotions but now it um it actually is good because i know that when things are occurring  um if i'm able to um communicate about them with a certain individual it um relieves me of the stress of of uh trying to figure out everything alone and often times um by speaking about the issues it um allows me to come up with an alternative plan that may be be better just because i'm hearing myself speak of the issue  um i was diagnosed with depression and um my doctor felt that i should probably see the therapist um i am it depends um if i'm really busy during the week and have a lot of things to do i often try to plan things and if i'm planning things it affects my sleep i might wake up in the middle of the night so sometimes it's easy and sometimes it isn't irritable um very <v> just very irritable um i was feeling anxious but now i'm calmer um today i don't but i have in the past week um because i was in the midst of um searching for a a stable <s> a stable place to live and um it was just taking so long to find a stable place to live so i was becoming anxious  thank you yes um  maybe in october um well my mother first came she came to visit me in october and when she first got here we had a good time for the first couple days um so i was happy to see her i hadn't seen her in over a year mhm um i'm proud that i'm able to um  adjust to different situations um the older i've gotten the more adaptable i am to <t> in different environments in different situations and um i've learned how to be more resourceful so i'm proud of that um i'm sorry oh my dad and uh my sister she's positive 'cause she's finished her master's degree um my mom sometime um my best friend is very positive 'cause she just started her new business two years ago and she's very enthusiastic about it so that's an inspiration  um when someone lies consistently  um i listen very very well um sometimes i um give good advice i'm a good friend um i normally do the things that i say i'm going to do so i'm dependable um i communicate well  and i um enjoy people's company most of the time especially if they're in good moods um being around positive people music um puts me in a good mood um comedy shows put me in a good mood um good food puts me in a good mood  um when i graduated from high school it was a really um i will never forget it it was a wonderful day very confident accomplished and i was um extremely optimistic and hopeful for the future  you're welcome bye

would've went sooner but better late than never probably i'm not sure i haven't really thought about it i wanna work in the field of psychology but i'm not sure if i wanna work with children or adults so i haven't really decided  no <laughter> i don't know i just don't maybe once a year um june actually i went to uh orlando florida sometimes yeah not as i'm sorry um watch t_v read a book talk on the phone mhm mad mm <sigh> my mom gets in my business <laughter> other than that um i guess just frustrations with my son no <laughter> um the hardest thing is um raising a child with a disability not knowing how you can help him it is it's very hard i don't sugarcoat it at all just having my children they're a blessing i love 'em <laughter> with all the good and the bad it's a part of me and i just love the fact that i'm helping mold them into  good human beings <laughter> we're really close i mean my family's small we live within blocks of each other but yeah we're close  good or bad <laughter> most memorable just giving birth for the first time it was just amazing my son is nine now so i still remember it like it was yesterday <laughter> like i was being born again myself i don't know how to explain it it just very emotional <laughter> i don't know <laughter> i guess i have a lot of regrets but none that i really wanna mention i guess <laughter> stay in school <laughter> don't get emotionally involved and um let people deter you from your goals <laughter> oh yeah definitely did you wanna move on i'm okay i mean i'm pretty easygoing  for the most part i don't really have a temper per se things frustrate me more than they anger me xxx oh that's easy <laughter> with my mother she's like um i guess the argument stemmed from me wanting to socialize <laughter> she feels that i'm married with children so i should stay at home like ninety nine percent of the time and i wanted to go out and socialize with some ex co-workers and she basically kinda put me down for it as if i don't spend enough time with my children <laughter>  it does and i love my mom i hate even having the thoughts of being frustrated with her because i always think gosh i don't wanna get mad at her and then something happens to her the next day but she gets kinda intrusive <laughter> i don't know <laughter> oh i know um after the semester ended when i noted that i  you know i did well in school 'cause i had been it had been a long time since i went to school so when i received my grades you know a and a b i was like wow okay i can do this and it made me happy and that was about a few weeks ago i guess mhm thank you my mom i know it's good and bad <laughter> i mean for the most part my mom's been a positive influence you know it's just sometimes you know she gets a little like she wants to re-raise me or something like she doesn't understand that i'm an adult i'm gonna make my own decisions now and  pretty much have to let me do what i need to do <sigh> a lotta  heavy breathing <laughter> i mean i walk sometimes when i get a lil' frustrated whatever i'll just go take a walk you know or um just try not to think about it thank you <laughter> yes yes the navy i was nineteen yeah <laughter> yeah i didn't have any other options <laughter> i am i probably should've stayed in a lil' longer i was only in for four years but  you know i wanted to experience life outside the military so i did my enlistment and then i got out it made me a little bit more responsible than some of my friends that you know did not join the military i can notice a big difference as far as you know how i live my life and how they live theirs um just made me a little bit more responsible thank you <laughter> i worked in the medical field for about five years and uh oh thank you <laughter> but um it wasn't for me i wanted to do something lil' bit different i didn't wanna do patient care i wanted to work with people but not necessarily as a patient care provider so i started going to school and then i met my husband i stopped going to school got married and i started working in a telecommunications field and then we you know conceived our child and after that you know <laughter> <laughter> i think i'm caring well i know i am i'm very caring you know i'm very honest  to a fault sometimes you know i try to be as honest as possible with people sometimes it can hurt their feelings but you know you gotta be honest you can't let people think that you know you're not trusting and if mm yeah probably i don't i never really thought about it i don't know <laughter> maybe i don't really think about it i just try to be the best person that i can be you know so all i can do i can't live for what other people think i can only do what i need to do <laughter>  um i don't know <laughter> i never really thought about it  i guess it just you know being around my kids you know i just love being around my children and that's always puts me in a good mood <laughter> thank you okay like i said a lil' tired you know but you know for the most part okay you know i'm dealing with situations that well i go to bed really early so long as i go to bed early i get a good night's sleep but i wake up early as well so <laughter> it's kinda like good and bad a lil' bit i go to bed like eight eight thirty and then i wake up at like one one thirty so <laughter> very moody very irritable short short-tempered i guess if anything i think i'm thinking more positively you know like i said especially with my son having a disability you know i i look at it as if you know it's not all bad i mean he has challenges eh but i'm dealing with them a lot better you know as opposed to feeling sorry for him or feeling sorry for myself you know i'm just finding more avenues to work with him you know different resources to help him as opposed to just feeling guilty or sad and depressed about it thank you no occasionally who doesn't <laughter> i don't know can we skip that question <laughter> <sigh> green <laughter> seems to be the word kinda like um yeah probably green like naive a little <laughter> but at the same time smart i think she'll describe me as smart  mhm yeah okay

yes i'm okay  i'm from uh los angeles california originally  yes sunshine uh the weather's great  it's about it smog pollution crime um  certain things like that yeah  i did in one point in my life i was in the military so don't do hardly a lot of traveling no more  seeing different sights different people i think it's more the people and being around different types a city and the people <peop> see meeting different new people  uh <sigh> i traveled to uh  new york one time and uh it was quite different big city  different people  uh that's about it  eighteen  uh yes i was <laughter>  uh no i did a lot of combat training but no combat  mm disciplined more uh more motivated uh you get a lot of things done more <laughter> even when you don't wanna do 'em you know you just go back to your army days and you get motivated off the stuff that that that you really needed to get done but you didn't wanna do it but it got done uh like uh  you had to uh do a lot of cleaning uh you had to wake up pretty early you had to do a lot of p_t you had to uh stay up to like two three o'clock in the morning you didn't wake back up until four or five yes <y> uh <laughter> to a certain point yes  after the military i joined the national guard and i did uh fifteen sixteen years in there uh i was uh excuse me ma'am i didn't hear that <th> quite hear that uh what made me decide to do that  uh just the motivation just you know really wanted a career see if i could find a career from it and it helped me out a little bit yeah    thank you  it wasn't that easy  uh i mean i'm sorry it was easy it didn't bother me too much to go back to civilian life  yeah it didn't bother me at all i just <ju> i adjusted pretty well  uh <sigh> history basically a lot um  yeah just basically history  uh no i'm not i'm uh disabled oh no it's okay it's okay we can all i can heal i can get better hopefully i will  yes i try to keep a  excuse me ma'am i guess i don't  my dream job would probably be working with others working with young people working with kids seeing that they get the uh the right and proper uh uh education that's you know that's due to them so they can be productive in the life of society as we live in today  yeah  excuse me  <sigh> what i think about 'em i think uh they should uh be more more uh <sigh> xxx i mean they should they should <sh> participate <tapicitate> more in what they're doing in their lives they should ask more questions they should be more motivated to uh really achieve something within their lives to give them the mm to give them the confidence and the motivation they need in life 'cause a lot of 'em don't get it <sigh> when i see people do really really stuff that they really shouldn't be doing  uh <sigh> it really eeks me i mean really bothers me and when people talk to you they give you the run-around it's like won't you just be straight with me instead of just giving me the the run-around <laughter> won't you just be straight up with me that can be very frustrating uh and really when people do really i'm trying to find the right word stupid stuff <laughter> that really botthers me too   uh spray painting on the wall  uh just throwing garbage anywhere and not picking it up uh not really being uh you know not really being  hygiene you know taking care of yourself and being hygiene you know what i mean  yeah  <sigh> what i do when i'm annoyed uh i get really upset i really start really cussing people out to be honest with you and it's something that's not really me but uh i'm learning to really let go of it a lot you know just you know just say hey that's the way it is it's like i'm not in control i can't control it yeah i have only have to control the things about what i do and really getting upset off of what other people do is not really good it's not good for me oh my temper can be controlled i can control it pretty well  uh  i i don't know i think it probably was my sister and she's very controlling and it's like you have your life and i have mine don't tell me what to do yeah  we real close i can get along with 'em we're real close i have no problems with them   yeah very good  uh  this morning <laughter>  yeah i wake up pretty you know i i first thing i do when i wake up in the morning i pray so when my spirit's in connection with the uh <sigh> the universe and the world i i feel pretty good   yes  uh <sigh> up and down you know up because i'm motivated to get out and start doing other things in life than just not doing anything at all and then other times where you wanna get something accomplished and you can't really get it done because there's road blocks in the way but uh i'm learning how to uh overcome those road blocks as well uh  well for instance uh looking to go to school and i was having problems uh getting enrolled in school i was talk to one of my social workers and she was willing to help me get online and uh to do it so i'm like okay it's well it's gonna get done <laughter> yeah  uh can you repeat that one more time ma'am  uh yes i have  see i had to be uh <sigh> i'd say uh for the last couple of weeks uh i noticed that i go through certain situations like you was talking about the anger situation it's like i don't get angry all the time that's not me so sometimes when i get angry i have to find out what's causing all this what's what's causing me to get angry  and i have to take  excuse me ma'am  uh it's not hard at all 'cause alls you have to do is just take your time and reflect about everything uh that you have gone through and uh take a good look at the situation and uh and then go from there and find out what's what's really bothering you  it's very seldom  uh i suffer from p_t_s_d and uh getting that type of sleep would be would be great  because i have recurring nightmares so of a incident so  <sigh> i i think it is and i don't know what it's triggered by but i think it is and that's why i'm talking to someone or seeing someone 'cause i'm a veteran  at the uh v_a about the situation now about the p_t_s_d basically right now  excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> a lot of nightmares lot of problems lot of anger issues uh depression uh i noticed all this in me and uh i started i just started to just tell myself i needed help  and that's that's basically it i just you know i just you know i just something wasn't wrong with it something wasn't right with me  and when something's not right with me i have to take time out to just you know take a good look at myself and ask myself if something's right then you if something's right then that's fine if something's not right then you need to take care of it   and uh i just started seeking help down there yeah  somewhat yes it is somewhat  'cause i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist  well i'm able to sit down and talk to the therapist and uh tell 'em my situation and we usually will go over the problem and uh i went to classes i've been to uh uh talking one-on-one with my own doctor so it's helping out a little bit  yeah  it's a good thing excuse me ma'am no no not really  my best friend  uh they he would describe me as a fun loving good person always there that try to help others uh  think more of others really than more of myself but when i know i need things need to be done for me i take care of it so you know and they really actually they really look up to me they have a lot more respect for me yeah they see something in me they wish that they had   excuse me ma'am uh can you be a little bit more specific  oh okay  uh books crossword puzzles uh walking that's about it  i thought i did but i don't think i do i don't think i regret anything because  this is this is how it is this is the way it is for me so i accept it and i keep moving on  because if i regret anything in the past then i'm wasting my time on that because it's gone that's the past i need to move on i need to live in the present so i can be prepared for the future so i can move on to the future  yeah  <sharp inhale> uh <sigh> more education uh  being more direct and more confidence in what i'm doing like i am today so yeah that's what i was lacking maybe twenty years ago  uh yes <ye> yes i have had a lot of positive people been been in my life  uh <sigh> yeah some people would uh uh uh well consistently <cons> xxx i mean consistently motivate me to continue and to pursue a certain goal and uh i thought that was pretty good because i really don't see that a lot and uh he gave me a lot of motivation to try to go up and try to do certain things 'cause anything that you do it's a choice it's up to you whether or not if you do it or not that choice is still up to you for it to be done   excuse me ma'am  uh <sigh> that i'm able to really be able to be self-motivated and really be able to put my best foot forward and be able to get a lot of things accomplished which i thought i couldn't but it can be accomplished if i'm willing enough to put the will to it to do it oh wow huh  oh really and you know what i really enjoyed was sitting down with my social worker and we're talking about getting things done within my life and school was one of 'em uh  and just being just school was one of 'em and i kinda liked it that because that was the first time someone was willing to really sit down with me and work with me  yeah and i thought that was a great thing so as long as you're willing to do that i'm willing to go even the extra mile and even be motivated to do other things besides school and uh yeah that and that and that's what gets me going oh it is and i love it and uh this is going to be accomplished  thank you  goodbye  
hi yeah i'm okay  i'm doing great  yeah  um i am from los angeles i was born in santa monica yeah um i like um  i don't know there's nothing i mean i don't really like it here that much but i guess i

problems and stuff uh yeah just as long as i'm you know helping other people smile and you know relating my problems with other people  um i'm pretty <pr> i'm close well i'm really close with my grandma um eh my family it's just eh we're not like too too close we kinda argue a lot <laughter> yeah  um sorry what's an introvert  okay  when i'm annoyed um well i try to relax for a minute i

help on that <laughter>  um no not really i mean no i guess it's not like as bad as like most people i've never like been in a fight or anything or yeah any of that  um i argued with my mom and sister yesterday it was just something stupid over like my sister is sitting was sitting in the front seat and she's a kid and it's like i'm i should be in the front seat so i just asked her to sit in the back and of course they start like yelling and arguing and it's like really annoying <laughter>  yeah it does thanks  my grandma she's always giving me encouragement and um she's a therapist a licensed therapist so she's always you know made it really really um  easy for me to have someone to talk to and i could always go to her so that helps yeah  yeah  my most memorable experiences well i had one really good experience um i went horseback riding and that was really really made me happy uh i love horses and nature that's the biggest thing that i love and it just made me so happy and so relaxed so that was a memorable experience <laughter>    um caring very caring always there to talk to um i don't judge i never judge i'm never cranky i'm never i never ever get like angry at anybody else just like my family you know but yeah just very nice caring and stuff <laughter> um things that put me in a good mood like uh music nature um i like to cook a lot i like to cook you know for my family talking puts me in a really good mood i love meeting new people meeting new people puts me in the best mood uh it's not easy um it's hard um sometimes it's it's really hard um   i don't usually sleep well so um yeah i have trouble falling asleep mostly  um i guess it's just like my mind will be racing a lot of you know sometimes it'll be flashbacks of bad memories um just you know thinking too much <laughter> um i don't know um i think just uh  stress you know a lot of stress every day just everyday stress uh yeah pretty much that's what triggers it <laughter>  um i just try to stay positive i try to think like okay well you know one day things will get better um   i just i try to call somebody and talk to them if i have trouble like my grandma  yeah  thanks when i don't sleep well um well i start to like cry a lot and i start to get really irritable um i get really depressed it makes me not feel well at all i get very uh it just is really really bad if i don't get sleep yeah  yeah  thanks yes i was diagnosed um three years ago  uh i just i didn't really know what was going on then i realized okay well they just diagnosed that and um i was like okay well this is the problem and it i just wanted help because it just when your mind is after you like that's like it's just awful to have your mind taking control of you like that  yeah  yeah it's hard  um yeah yeah i definitely always thought i had a problem i always thought something was like really wrong um i just always like kinda nervous around people like i never can really like look anybody in the eye 'cause i'm just so nervous my eyes are always kind of like racing and i um would have sweats if i was in the situation um that reminded me of the situation like i just try to avoid what reminds me and brings those flashbacks yeah  oh um i i've been feeling good i've been getting out more every day i'm trying to um i guess walking keeps my mind off my p_t_s_d symptoms so i'm trying to walk more that helps  thanks um yeah i have depression um yeah  um it helps yeah it actually does help me a lot um i currently don't have one right now i'm actually getting a new one in a few days though like it's kind of a mix-up but yeah it really really helps me  um i noticed that i've had less flashbacks and um i've been more relaxed i guess and um yeah just you know trying to keep more occupied yeah it helps  um the last time i felt really happy um i guess um i don't know um today 'cause i mean i'm glad to be part of this <laughter>  um most proud of uh well <sigh> um i'm trying to think of what i'm most proud of um  i  think i'm most proud of like the fact that i am able to you know not be like well i mean most people i know they like deny that they have a problem and i'm proud that i can actually like you know be a person who can realize okay i have a problem and i need help but a lot of the people i know they don't take medication they're untreated and um they just don't wanna get any help and i'm glad to get help because i don't wanna feel that way and i wanna get help for the problem instead of doing that  oh gosh there's a lot i regret yeah there's a lot um i regret you know uh drug abuse you know but that's part of you know the p_t_s_d i regret um a lot uh mistakes you know relationships stuff like that  wow um i would've told myself to um i guess the advice i would've given myself was to  try to keep my mind more relaxed i guess yeah um well i'm a very nice person and i always like to smile people are always saying how i smile a lot but um the smile i guess it kind of hides like what's on the inside but you know i'm pretty depressed you know but i just try to keep smiling and i always like to lend a hand to help and make people feel better  for fun um i like to go to the mall that's a lot fun i like to go to the mall i like to go out with my grandma we go places go shopping i love shopping and um i like to go um play like games like i like to play video games

yes  i'm doing fine thank you  originally i'm from well i was born in mississippi so i'm from gulfport mississippi  yes  i didn't have a choice i was a child i moved here with my parents  <laughter> uh when i was two years old  <laughter> yes i was i was a toddler  yes i like to travel and i travel a lot  um being around new environments and new people uh different things  <cough> um well one of my favorite trips was visiting africa in i think two thousand six i visited uh west africa and that was a great trip for me it was a medical mission where we volunteered and gave medical assistance to people  a friend of mine uh was actually involved and she talked to me about getting involved so i went in with her and it went from there so i don't know i made the decision that way   i am i am happy i did that it's something i'll never forget <laughter>  i studied english and education so that i could teach high school students  uh not currently no well right now i um tutor privately for a private tutoring company and looking to get back into the classroom working as a teacher  mhm wow anything that uh combines teaching traveling and writing would be a dream job for me so yeah anything that combines those three items so teaching has the closest outcome to that    um  occasionally yes <laughter> um <clears throat>  i don't know i guess in comparison to others that are considered outgoing um and and a lot of people have said i seem reserved or kinda introverted i don't know   mm well  i don't know i read um i just started meditation  mm try to breathe and calm down <laughter> yeah  some things that make me really mad um  mistreatment of children  abuse of children  um try to figure out what's annoying me usually and then go from there uh if i can control not being annoyed like ultimately i control that whether or not i'm annoyed so try to figure out what the problem is and then go from there and not be annoyed <laughter> if i can help it all  oh i'm fine i can totally <to> in at controlling my temper i think so i don't have a yeah    the last time i argued with someone  was um  i don't know maybe a couple of days ago and it was about um it was about um a smell they had on their clothes but i thought smelled like perfume and they said it did not so <laughter>  yeah  <laughter> this is cool uh i think i'm very close to my family we're a pretty close knit family talk every day um see each other almost every day  there've been a lot of positive um influences in my life i would say my aunt and uh definitely my mother have all been positive influences  well um i look i look <l> i uh <clears throat> look up to my aunt um i think she's positive i look up to her  because obviously we grew up with very similar backgrounds came from very similar neighborhoods and areas and she's very successful um despite the types of things that we've gone through as children  and um she doesn't let her past define her future uh my mom's overcome so many obstacles as well um she had some challenges with her health but she still tries to be optimistic and she's still tries to   you know overcome these things and just still live our life despite some physical barriers that she might have so i look up to people who are able to  you know not allow their current situation to dictate their future because anything is possible   no i have not  no i have  um well i was diagnosed um within the last um year and uh then again most recently within the last three months  well um fear and just not knowing what to do with uh some of the things i was feeling and not knowing um you know why i couldn't stop feeling the way i was feeling  there were a lot of symptoms um  um you know mostly i uh i gained a lot of weight um i couldn't sleep a lot and then sometimes i could sleep too much <laughter> um  felt sad sometimes  like i wanted to cry a lot  i've been feeling okay um there are days yeah um i don't know every day is different so i mean today i feel fine but like i said everything is differently lately i've been feeling um more like i can be involved <inv> involved in my own life and like i wanna get   out and do more things  um  no no it's no no i haven't  not any different from before what i was experiencing before  no  mm well mm i was receiving um  uh i guess psychotherapy and um i don't know a lot of things happened i moved for a while to go take care of my grandmother and i just kinda  got more involved in taking care of other people instead of myself for a while  uh sometimes  i do  yes it is it's kinda difficult um i either have a hard time falling asleep or a hard time staying asleep i'm sure it is i just don't know what it is as of yet because i you know <sniffle> usually it's um thoughts continual thoughts running through my mind that either keep me up or make it hard for me to uh go asleep or make it hard for me to stay asleep mhm um journal sometimes uh that might help if i can write some things down and get it out that helps other than that i don't you know i haven't found any really great ways of coping  it tired <laughter>  yeah mostly uh tired um kinda confused  i don't know for the most part i feel happy it's just um   last time i felt really happy was i guess over the holidays  uh i don't know i guess the just being around uh family and friends just the holiday season i guess in general that's just a happy time for me and seeing people i haven't seen in a while um that's about it  how would my best friend describe me probably as um  quiet sometimes cautious talkative sometimes um tenacious  um i don't know a lot of my friends say that they look up to me for uh some of my accomplishments and they also say that they are grateful to have me as a friend because i'm caring and compassionate or um easy to talk to um that i remind them of a of <o> feel like a sister to them  <laughter>  um everyone has regrets i'm sure yeah i regret stuff  to just  relax and be yourself and just go ahead and it sounds cliche and i don't mean to sound that way but it's true it's just um you have to learn how to be comfortable with you and relax and just know you um to not compare yourself to other people because what someone else is doing or where they may be in their life at a certain time is not necessarily where you are supposed to be or what you're supposed to be doing at that time it doesn't mean that you're less competent or less able to do it it just means that everyone has their path and everyone has their  their time and their progression to how they get to things so i would tell me ten years ago to just believe in me and stay on my own path for what it is that i want for my life and don't be  yeah  um really enjoyed working with um well  okay a science project <laughter> with um my younger uh relatives my cousins we did a science project together and it was fun despite the mess we made it was a ball um being the first to attend college in my family and then um going to college and coming back to the community where i uh went to school and then teaching in that community and volunteering in that community and helping um youth or children that come from the same background that i came from so  uh i'm most proud of being able to  have the opportunity to improve and better myself and then to come back and help someone else improve and better themself as well   goodbye  
yes <clears throat> okay um new york um to pursue um music industry a job in the music industry  uh yes i'm self-employed um to become a music producer um it's pretty hard there's a lot of competition <laughter> um to pursue a job uh when um about a year ago last february it was pretty difficult east coast is a lot different than the west coast um i think i've been there twice in the past year no i'm more of a creature of habit um yes uh sometimes i feel like i don't fit into the crowd so um it's better just sometimes to be more quiet and view everything instead of uh you know going in and actively pursue things um <laughter> probably uh listen to music um and spend time with my dogs um <clears throat> probably um people being insensitive <insen> um not very um very nice to me or um seeing injustices or um i think that's about it <laughter> um pretty good you know sometimes <so> um probably couple of days ago um one of my friends was saying that um mm uh they were making a comment about how i am and i got kind of upset about that yeah it does <laughter> pretty close um my best friend so i um oh just one of my friends um i kind of am quiet about it and when a person pushes me to a certain point that's when i overreact usually um it's pretty hard um i rather the person notice that i'm kinda getting withdrawn and actively engage in me instead of getting it to the point where it's like um it it comes to a point where it blows out of proportion  um um probably spending time with my family in new york very close um my sister and my brother um i don't know they're just great people and i love them a lot and they're a lot like me so i feel like i have people that understand me um probably um i guess loyal um sensitive um <laughter>  i don't know it's kind of hard <laughter> it's a hard question <laughter> no no <clears throat>  yes gosh um i think probably nineteen ninety seven so a long time ago um i'm just uh during that time i was just going through a lot of issues and i was feeling unsafe to myself so i ended up going um to the doctor to kinda get meds and have therapy and stuff um not currently i i did about like six months ago um i just felt the therapist wasn't really helping me um i felt we kept on talking about the same things over and over and xxx she wasn't really challenging me and i've been in therapy for a really long time so i just knew it was a change it's okay <laughter> um yes i do actually um  when i feel connected to a therapist um and when i feel like it's a really great way for me to talk about what i'm going through um so yes i do um i'm better at describing my emotions and feelings i think the biggest thing is um when i'm in situations eh i can see myself reacting one way and i take a step back and see how i can react normally almost in a way um    also i tend to take a lot of my emotions and feelings and kind of bury them and make them feel like really bad about myself so it's nice to talk to someone that's not judging that doesn't really tell me like you know um they tell me it's o okay basically <clears throat> um feeling hopeless all the time not having you know enough energy to do things i used to like i had a little bit of concentration issues  um having weird disturbing thoughts sometimes just pop into my mind and just overall just feeling kinda crummy about life  um sometimes they are at  like random moments that if there's like a problem with like my interpersonal life or something like that or if i sometimes even seeing something on television um like sometimes that affects me  um listening to music or trying to distract myself um trying like my therapist told me for the longest time to journal to record things <clears throat>  um it's been a tough transition to come here so uh well being <be> being here um so um kinda half and half okay and not okay <laguhter>  um i feel like i've been a little bit with more withdrawn lately um but that's about it um <clears throat> some days it's great some days it's not um more recently it's been a little bit more difficult um i don't know why i have like a lot of thoughts on my mind at night <clears throat> so i tend not to sleep very well and i wake up quite frequently during the night <clears throat> um <clears throat> very groggy in the morning and um that's about it like during the day i tend to yawn a lot and my friends always are like oh why are you yawning so much are you disinterested <disisinterested> in what we're doing and then trying to tell them it's not that at all <laughter> um probably christmas time when i was with my family  um just really happy and um feeling like everything was alright in my life  having a good sense of like where i was at that moment being present with myself um probably you know um let's see that's a hard question i think probably i can tend to read people kinda well sometimes and um  uh i like to say uh i'm good at like being a good friend to people being a good family member um i'm a hard worker when i do have a job so <laughter>  um um sure i mean it's life so of course there's regrets um one that comes to mind is um the wish that i don't eat as much so i can be a lot more healthy <laughter>  um don't take things so seriously <laughter> um enjoy being youthful and um i think that's it <laughter> um i don't know that's a good question probably um my previous job and my employment i worked really well with kids um  so i did a great job at that i was um a researcher um at a hospital and i helped a lot of kids out for about six years so seven years  yeah it was awesome um i was really kind of like um  reading people and so i decided to major in psychology <clears throat> so uh and then i went a worked in a um mental health facility and did research um with them with um with drugs and depression and things like that so it found like a good niche for me <laughter> okay no problem <laughter> goodbye <laughter> 
yes  i'm doing pretty good <laughter>  i'm from oklahoma  mhm yup oklahoma city  uh the weather is great i love being near the ocean and the palm trees and uh mountains i just love it here <laughter> um it was pretty easy there's a few differences it's a huge city compared to where i'm from so traffic has definitely been an adjustment for me <laughter>  um i just always wanted to live in california uh hated being landlocked in oklahoma just wanted to get out to the west coast be near the ocean   i studied psychology and minored in art  um no not at the moment  um well actually i think i misunderstood your question i'm not still working on my degree but i am working in the field of psychology i well i just got hired working at a group home for teenage boys who have been in trouble with the law  my dream job oh  i don't really know i think i just wanna help people however i can and um i just like working with people in the realm of psychology so i think i may already have my dream job <laughter> to relax i like to read or watch movies um i like to go to the beach and just watch the sunset or um hang out with friends  things that make me really mad um probably injustice towards other people um people being mistreated or abused um and people being lied to and deceived including myself i hate being lied to <laughter>  when i'm annoyed uh depends on the situation but i try to just like count to ten and take a deep breath and and not let my emotions cause me to react in a negative way so i just try and like calm down before i say anything  um it depends again on the situation and like who i'm angry with um most of the time i'm pretty good at controlling it but sometimes i think like like most people i'll lash out at the people that i'm closest to at times and and those moments i'm not that good at controlling it  <sigh> when was the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my parents um i've been having some some car trouble lately and i'm also running low on money so i'm sure i don't even remember exactly but i'm sure we kind of probably fought about the fact that i you know need to be more self-sufficient and independent take care of my own <laughter> things like car issues  i am very close with my family they're still in oklahoma but i talk to them on the phone all the time  oh definitely i mean my mom i think um she's probably the person that i'm closest to and she just  she's a great role model she's a wonderful person and she's very hardworking and very unselfish and i just wanna be like her in those ways  oh probably the time i went bungee jumping over the nile river in uganda um i still kinda have flashbacks of that moment just freefalling it was like the coolest experience ever and i love doing things that are crazy like that so it was a fun time <laughter> yeah well i have <ha> i have traveled a lot nowadays i don't travel so much anymore but i used to work for a cruise line um norwegian cruise line and so i would go travel all the time with them and then i also did an eleven month long trip around the world uh it was a mission trip so i just went and helped out in different third world countries it was really cool  uh i just love going to different places seeing new places and meeting all different types of people um because it's easy to just like get so absorbed in your own small bubble that you forget that there's a huge world out there and there's all different types of people with all different types of beliefs and it's just really cool to be able to branch out and see and meet those types of people and see just the diversity and the terrain of the earth even and the way that the earth looks in different places is cool  no i have not served in the military <laughter>  nope no i've never been formally diagnosed although i would say i've probably diagnosed myself with depression um just after having studied it a lot in psychology throughout the years i've i'm probably ninety nine percent sure that i've struggled with depression off and on so yeah   lately it's been pretty easy but throughout the years i've definitely had a lot of issues with insomnia um just like either not being able to fall asleep or just like waking up constantly throughout the night and so right now i'm not really experiencing too much of that but in the past it's definitely been an ongoing issue for me   i'm not a pleasant person when i don't sleep well sleep is extremely like important for me i think maybe more so than a lot of people i i like need good sleep to function  i've been feeling really good um  over the past several months i was unemployed um after coming out here and that was really really tough um and i just recently got offered my job um just like last week so i definitely think i've been going through a lot of crap and just a lot of depression but it's like lifted a lot of it has been lifted off me because i don't have that pressure any longer of like how am i gonna make ends meet this city's really expensive and i don't have a job and so i feel i feel much more relieved than i have been feeling which is good <laughter> um yeah well i mean just like i said over the past week or so i've become a lot more  positive i was kind of like feeling a bit like a hermit in a way it's just hard like being in a new city and not really knowing too many people and of course like i said not having a job kind of causes you to kind of just like be in your own shell i guess and that was kinda how it was how it's been for me and um just since i got offered the job i just have so much more confidence and like positivity that um things are are starting to work out for me which is good <laughter>    oh it was probably a couple of days ago actually i went um  i went to explore a part of the south bay area that i hadn't really been to before and it was i was just gonna go for a jog along the beach and it was really foggy outside and then the fog started to lift and um it was just beautiful and then i i went for a drive up off kind of off this like cliff where there's beautiful scenery that i'd never seen before and i just like was overwhelmed with how pretty it was and i was just like oh i can't believe that i get to live here so that was definitely a happy moment for me <laughter>  my best friend would probably say that i'm very daring and bold and fearless um that i'm unique and artistic and i don't i would guess that she'd probably say that i'm a non-conformist i don't really think the way that a lot of people do and i question everything so which can be a good or bad thing but yeah <laughter>  um  probably just like the fact that i i really try to live my life with like no regrets and just i try to live a very exciting life in a way and i think that especially ever since i finished college and have been traveling like i have and i've tried moving all different places by myself so i think just the fact that i i'm not really afraid i don't let things hold me back i just if i want something or if i wanna do something i can just do it and i guess in a way like i like that about myself and the fact that i'm really independent and can just go and do whatever i feel like doing even if it's hard i still i'm proud that i've overcome a lot of those struggles  oh there's like minor things that i regret throughout my life but there's not anything really major 'cause i think pretty much everything that i've done i've learned from whether it's good or bad so i wouldn't really change anything  oh <sigh> i would say i would tell myself when i was a kid that i  should just keep dreaming big and don't let anything that anyone says like stop me from believing that anything's possible because um i guess as i've grown into an adult i've really seen and started to really believe that truly anything is possible and if you really want something you can go after it and you can get it so i would just tell myself to never give up and just always believe that you can do what you wanna do  oh  let's see that's kind of hard <laughter>  um oh i guess i went home recently for christmas back to oklahoma and um i got to see some of my friends from college that i hadn't seen in some of 'em i hadn't seen in like since i graduated so um which has been like four years ago so um it was really awesome just to go out with them and we went to dinner and we went out afterwards and just had a good night and it was really really fun  cool you're welcome  bye  
yes  i'm okay  um pennsylvania  mhm um well i was in boston for a couple years and then i moved here about three and a half years ago but um i just wasn't satisfied with the quality of my life um maybe once or twice last year i only got to back once a year um definitely safer and um definitely a more um well i just miss it 'cause i have a lot of family back there but l_a is okay i i mean everyone loves the climate here um  not too easy i have two really good friends here and i have a boyfriend i've been with for three years so that helps he's from here but um it definitely took a a bit of adjustment  no um advertising communications  um no i'm currently working in actually i'm not working right now at the moment um i wanna be an osteopathic physician  um so basically versus western medicine an osteopathic physician is someone who helps someone with the symptoms and doesn't just treat the symptoms but treats them as a whole person so they look at nutrition they look at diet exercise um just a variety of things to <t> to actually get someone to live  a healthier life versus medications or things that are commonly prescribed now in the western medicine  um well one of the great things was when i came out here to l_a i was um exposed to the degree which i had never heard of living on the east coast   um sometimes  um well i'm very particular about the people i like to surround myself with um and eh i don't like to socialize with a lot of people i mean i tend to um like small intimate groups and i don't tend to like to be in larger or bigger groups um eh when people don't take into account other people's feelings  um i usually  try to go for a walk if i get <laughter> very irritated  um i'm usually really good it really takes a lot for me to spill over and to yell or become upset   um <sigh> let's see uh mm i was at with my lawyer and it was about his handling of my case  yeah it was he's uh they're i don't know i think they're just a little bit mediocre they're not the best lawyers   i have no idea <laughter>  um i'm very trustworthy i'm loyal um i care very deeply so i i like to try to help other people um and i always like to try to cheer people up so <laughter> i think that's that would be some of 'em  no yes  um just a few months ago about in the last six months  um i was experiencing  mental issues that i'd never really came across before paranoia and anxiety and i knew that it wasn't  um i knew that i it wasn't that i couldn't overcome it by myself  um a lot better i've been doing a lot of yoga and meditation um kinda seeing things from a different per view or another <ano> not per <pe> per view but a different view and um  that's helped but there's definitely times where i kind of sink back into thinking about the event especially because the event caused me to stop working   um  i think i you know i have a difficulty being in public um i'm still dealing with anxiety and paranoia about that and that something may happen so um so a lot of times during the day is when it happened so i'm not that comfortable going out during the day i tend to go out in the mornings and evenings and um i don't like to go into places where there's only one way in and one way out um well i've been gradually trying to increase how much i'm outside um  and i usually just deep breathing um i do a lot of breathing exercises and i just try to say that basically what i'm thinking or what's going on with me is not real um and that   i just i try <laughter> i just try to get myself to go into these places more gradually a lot better since uh the last couple months but before i very much pretty much stayed home    um  it's been good um it's been good to hear someone's feedback but um i feel like i've gotten more help with just my inner talk with just kind of sitting with myself and journaling  i do  um <sigh> well i feel like more like myself which is a huge improvement um and i am more cautious and er guarded in some ways about my thoughts um and about my decisions as well i'm not so i'm not so oh you know i'll just do this and not really think of the consequences of other things that i want in my life   um it's gotten better i'm okay <ok> i'm better now um the first three months it was very difficult i couldn't sleep through the night and i woke maybe two or three times and would be awake for a couple hours but now i am um sleeping through the night again  um i feel <f> groggy <sigh> k i feel foggy and out of it um  and just low kind of depressed  mm <sigh> it's um i think it's been awhile  um working <laughter> i'm a bit of a workaholic um spending time with my family um yeah just being outside enjoying nature reading um very close  what is that  um scrubbed_entry um well my parents 'cause they've always been very supporting and loving um giving me feedback about my decisions or what i'm choosing to do but allowing me to make my own um decisions my own choices in life and then  my sisters have just always been very um you know just always checking with me i'm the baby i'm the youngest in the family so they always um  looking out for me and just checking in with me and then my boyfriend xxx with this um incident that happened um he's been very uh usually supportive with just letting me kind of have my talk and work things out and understanding when i'm feeling and not wanting to go out in public and and being aware of that that it's not so easy for me just to do something like grocery shop or um running errands without having a lot of anxiety  um i'm most proud of  the jobs the work that i've done the people i've helped um  maybe that i took this job where i was assaulted at <laughter> that would be it going into retail into unsafe environment not listening to my gut  um  what advice would i what uh to recklessly pursue your dreams um that there is no such thing as too late or running out of time and and to enjoy every moment of your life not take anything for granted  um  let's see uh <sigh> well cooking i really enjoy <enj> i really enjoy cooking um  so i made some roasted vegetables just any time i'm cooking i just really enjoy it um we have a garden so we had collard greens that came up and um some chilis and cauliflower so just using preparing that for <f> um for my um boyfriend and i  mhm bye thanks  
yes alright  i was born in uh los angeles california  uh well the weather and uh  the fact that uh people aren't so obtrusive like on the east coast  uh just the uh the traffic and the the smoggy weather  i used to i'm unemployed now so i rarely go anywhere  i have a b_s in uh business with a uh computer uh option i thought that the only place i could get a job with a business <bu> business degree was in accounting or in business computer methods so i took that i took business computer methods option  oh i'd probably be like uh a professional sports player or an actor something something that you enjoy doing  i like to uh ride my bike i like to watch sporting events now i can't afford to go to them so i pretty much watch on t_v  i like to travel but like i say that i don't have money for that anymore  that's alright  uh <sigh> people who are chicken heads they get their nose in other people's business even if they're just strangers you expect that from a family member or or a friend but you know especially with the internet that feeds a lot of that now we know what orwell was referring to when he spoke of big brother in nineteen eighty four  uh i don't do much much different than i would otherwise  uh and i've had many temper outbursts uh  i kinda argue with my aunt  and it was because she was basically  making leading statements trying to trap me into saying something about a relative and uh it annoyed me greatly   uh i'm kind of on the outs with my parents  i'm kind of the black sheep  oh uh i mean my mom's done the most to help me she's done a lot you know more than uh anybody by far well i mean she's just  i remember one time when i was in like thirteen i went with a friend of mine to see the crosby stills nash and young concert at the forum  and she has seven kids and she picked me up at the sizzlers right across the street from the forum at uh eleven o'clock at night and i couldn't imagine with all she had to do that day that she agreed to do that but she did  oh probably uh  going down to the cape at the end of uh baja peninsula there's cabo san lucas or taking <ta> photographing the bridalveil falls in yosemite  uh it was probably the two most majestic seen <see> sights i've ever seen  it was when i could afford to travel  no no i was diagnosed with depression after a hospital visit in april of two thousand eleven    and uh i took some lexapro but i stopped after one day i didn't wanna do it anymore  no because i didn't feel it was helpful i feel i was becoming a zombie  yeah  depressed about not having a job for over two years i lost my job in october two thousand and ten and except for day you know jobs like this which i'm fortunate to get just you know daily things focus groups like that i haven't worked  thank you  especially when you're fifty six years old  well mm eh just uh it just the i guess the general feeling of hopelessness   i get out on my bicycle a lot and walk or bike just four hours a day split about two hours each  yeah good to get some very easy  'cause now i'm old when i was young i couldn't sleep more than six <s> four six hours a night  because i'm restless  no but now that i'm old i i i sleep much more easily  i pray before i go to sleep and that's that's that's when i can't have any trouble sleeping i just pray recite different prayers like the lord's prayer hail mary stuff like that and i'm able to fall off to sleep  i don't know probably uh  can't have any specific remembrances  of of that you know it was when i had money to spend i know that and when i had to have a job to have money to spend so it was probably fifteen years ago  well i haven't really enjoyed anything uh last week i did a uh made seventy five dollars on a job with the the county basically it was an emergency preparedness exercise they were running for their personnel and they enlisted people to play the basically the relatives of people who had been in a in a fall uh bombing at the staples center and we you know asked questions signed up you know told 'em gave 'em the information i'm missing  you know relatives and basically it was provided by the county and basically went through a routine in downtown l_a  not not hard it was just uh just a routine we had to follow we had to act like we were actually missing somebody and had to give the specifics of their characteristics height weight etcetera    i don't have a best friend  uh  i'm uh very bright i'm a perfectionist at my job  i'd say that's about it  i got a business degree and i've never been a motivated person i went to school i went to two state colleges and two junior colleges to meet that end so i believe that was probably the most significant contribution <con> contribution that i i made to my  you know to my uh i guess self esteem you might say so i had something to hang on the wall  yeah i regret you know  alienating family members  i would've uh  basically not been so impetuous and left left jobs thinking <think> thinking that  you know i could always get another one and not you know basically blow off jobs i could probably work at one of the employers that i used to work for now  they've added locations but i burned bridges there so that's not possible  thank you  hasta luego  
yes  okay  from here from eh from alhambra  uh the weather's really nice and everything's very familiar  uh sometimes there's too much congestion on the roads too too much traffic  i i studied art and photography uh it it wasn't so much a decision i just kept noticing that i was very interested in it  yes  i'm a photographer  mhm oh i suppose uh  um running a family portrait studio or some other type of photography business  uh no not no i'm an also an apartment manager it keeps me tied down  um it's uh fair it's not the greatest because of being an apartment manager i've i do have free rent but i have to stay there a lot so  that part does the free rent part is very good  oh gosh my most memorable experience that's hard to say  um  well i mean there's good and bad memorable experiences  oh well i guess some s s s like sport success when i was in high school there was a few of the things that i was happy about and some art pieces i've made were memorable and  some bad things would be my father's death you know but those are very memorable not good though  uh  well my parents and my i i have a lot of brothers and sisters uh so <s> so the my family uh fairly close but they most of them live around l_a uh there's a few that are from far <f> distant <di> uh distant my brother lives in new york and   my other brother lives in maui <clears throat>  mhm oh mostly very talented <ss> um just um more involved in technology than maybe i was or am and they're um i think they're more of a hive mind than when i grew up just seems like they were all hooked into social media  uh go on a walk or watch television  or play with my computer  and uh um well  there's some <so> some uh  there's some kind of uh  injustices that happen in not not <n> not big deals but for example our parking situation got worse with some new district parking eh that's kind of upsetting and the city doesn't seem to wanna  uh make any exceptions or change some rules  and also uh some unfair things at work sometimes happen that are upsetting <ups> uh that are upsetting uh yeah i worked for <f> in school <sch> uh uh at a high school <sch> i worked at a high school dance uh this last weekend and when we arrived at the site   the people at the site said we couldn't set up all of our equipment and backdrops and things at the location where we were assigned to do it that we had to go outside  and then to get an okay to go inside because being outside we weren't prepared for nor <no> nor told in advance that we were to be outside um it delayed our setup time and that doesn't <does> wouldn't have bothered me except that on monday morning um the school called <call> called our boss and complained that we were late setting up when it when they told us to wait for them and we told them we would be delayed if we wait and did we still get a complaint so that that part is upsetting and  and our work doesn't back us up the at the office they just need to please the school to maintain the account so uh often when that something like that happens it means they will not send you out to work at that school again which to would translate into less payroll hours for the the photographers that were on that job  that's yeah that's how they do things so that that is upsetting  uh most of the time that will i i dust off my resume <laughter> and start looking for other situations that are that might be better um  yeah  uh pretty good <sigh> i i i usually xxx might uh i in the moment i don't really lose it but xxx later i might um vent or something like that but on the spot <sp> on the location i wouldn't do that  um well just today um we have a uh schedule <sc> tight schedule today and i have a friend that i'm car <c> sharing a car with today and uh we we were arguing where to go first  and um so we compromised and did most of her things and one of my things then after  this <th> this was one of the things is over then we're gonna do some more of her things so but it yeah  no post-traumatic stress syndrome is that what that is  uh no i have not yes  oh <sigh> i'd say nineteen eighty yeah i think believe it was nineteen eighty yeah  um well my father noticed some symptoms my father is just well he's passed away but he was a psychiatrist  um well i wasn't sleeping i was laying around the house  um i was waking up at noon <laughter> something like and i didn't have a um focus like for getting a job it wasn't clear enough uh i i remember some job interviews that i'd go to their front door and then i wouldn't go in <laughter> and i think that was all all part of depression  yeah i thought i had a problem but i didn't know what it was  no uh well eh i went for three years and then the psychiatrist said that  he thought that i was done <laughter> but uh and i and i i did get to a much better place i have to watch all the time to see what's going on with depression so i think i i'll have good days and bad days  um i think therapy makes you see what the um  like the i i thought of it as a filter or wearing a pair <pa> as if you were put on a depression pair of sunglasses you don't really you see everything through that so you have to kinda <k> i have to sort of try to take the those glasses off for a little bit and double check am i really perceiving these things accurately  or am i seeing it through a depressed viewpoint and i try to look for clues about that   i think i'm um slipping back a little bit uh uh i don't do well during unemployed periods i've noticed in my path in my past and um right now we have a work slow down so it's easy to slip back into sleeping too late or putting things off because the schedule's too wide open for for me for me personally as a depressed person i think that structure is really important it um it gets you out of bed and you have to get somewhere in time and deal interact with people is all those are all beneficial things for someone who's tends to be depressed   uh  well i don't know if it's changes as i a little bit i just tend to be focused on some things that are probably not that um uplifting let's say uh but it's more negative like i have <ha> have been sort of thinking about how um um soldiers in the past uh i don't know why but like the in during the roman era <er> era or the greeks <gree> ancient greeks how it would've been like to be in a in a frontline battle with  mm you know just crude <cru> kind of crude <cru> in my opinion crude weapons and no medical help and  the i don't know i seem <se> my mind seems to go there a lot where i'm just thinking about that and i've been looking <look> looking at it and reading books about that or um video clips on youtube and eh things like that or um some other things <thi> other uh kinda like terrible doom type themes like i was watching on the animal show like crocodile attacks and things like that  where probably shouldn't dwell so much on that  oh you mean in life in general yeah well i think i regret not finishing college i think i had a i think i was <wa> uh was going into depression right then and wasn't coping in my senior year very well and um didn't really i didn't get out of college with a degree although i was there seven years but uh so that's very that's a big regret that i have um  i think it would've been to um  at certain points i probably should've sought <so> um sought therapy and also probably some uh outside help just with um getting through finals just the logistics i had i was an art major and i had no car so   a a lot of the art projects and things were difficult to move back and forth and and also to uh meet at away locations i think it probably would've been worth it to   do whatever it took to get a car <laughter> at that time so  um  well i'm i've been told i'm very patient  and also i have um some original original artistic ideas   so  um those are those are good qualities i'm very loyal and and also um  you know i support my friends i'm fairly generous with them  so yeah  um let's see  xxx really enjoyed was i had a  i had a nice experience uh just uh photographing um a soccer game recently   i really enjoyed that so  mhm okay  it was my pleasure  thank you goodbye

<synch> yes good how are you i am from los angeles yes um it's uh center of everything eh you can get to all the places you need to go to uh eh without having to drive very far um i like being in the city well being in l_a also you're dealing with traffic a lot of congestion and um obviously uh the environment as far as uh the air quality is not that great but you know you live with that um i was a business administration major so i studied business and um after i finished college i um uh pursued a career in retail operations uh no i as a matter of fact i am not i kinda changed career uh over the last four or five years so i'm concentrating more on the human resources side of the business um a couple of factors um i after working numerous years in the retail business i um switched over and worked in a uh creative business which was a graphic design firm and i uh captured a knowledge <knowl> a lot of knowledge um in the a in the human resources side because i was the operations manager slash benefits manager for a a small company yes i'm very happy i did that um i picked up on lot of knowledge and uh and it's very helpful <laughter> well my dream job is um i'm basically kinda doing what i wanna do now because i am a uh independent contractor i do freelance work as an h_r consultant using all the knowledge that i uh gained from previous jobs and um i utilize that with the flexibility to do the things i wanna do as far as personally and have the time i need to to do the things i wanna do and um obviously i worked hard early part of my career so the financial aspect of uh my retirement is already set in place so i do what i need to do as far as um maintaining a certain lifestyle but also i have i also enjoy what i do i'm not under as much stress as i used to be mm i'm not well i'm not totally outgoing but um i'm not i'm not extremely shy i'm probably right in the middle maybe more towards outgoing but i'm not totally outgoing i mean when i'm around other people i am uh in a social situation i i guess you could consider me an outgoing person but um obviously i do have my own little uh private issues that i keep to myself oh sure you know i have um uh couple years ago i had a heart attack and i had to have bypass operation and it had to yeah it had to do with stress and things like that i don't talk about that much other than those around me that are close to me um if i meet someone new i don't just openly say well you know i've experienced this this and this so i just basically um if it comes up i won't deny it or if it comes up and if it's if it i feel like it's something to talk about i will talk about it actually um my relaxation is um i'm currently um living with my mom my mother and uh she's a senior citizen and she's alone um so what i do for uh relaxation or to relieve stress is i actually help <he> help her do yard work take care of all the gardening and things like that and that's actually very uh therapeutic you know um i'm not um i'm not a short-fused kinda person it takes a lot to get me really angry so as far as um my temper's concerned there's not there's not much to that um i'm trying to think here <sigh> i can't recall when the last time it was but it was probably last year sometime when i um had a creditor that i was dealing with um being very difficult to work with um and i owed money as far as um some medical expenses that were incurred when i had my heart attack a few years ago and uh they weren't very understanding of the situation and i uh i really got a little upset about that because um i felt like i was being honest with them and i was i was more than willing to take care of my issues but uh they were playing hardball and i didn't care for that it does <laughter> probably the hardest xxx decision i ever had to make was um it had to do with a life and death situation with my my stepfather who was battling uh prostate cancer and yeah uh making a decision with my mother whether to proceed with a procedure that was gonna either um help him or there was a slight chance it was gonna help him even though he was pretty terminal at that point or it would it would kill him you know um and that was really tough it was really tough decision to make but uh uh you know i i felt like if i didn't try and see if we could save his life <l> help save his life or if it we didn't take a chance and and take that extra step that i would regret it in the long run it is it was um well right now um i'm separated from my wife so uh she has her issues i have my issues but we are not divorced we're just separated and um we still have a relationship where we still speak to each other we just don't live together and the relationship with my mother's really great you know um she's very understanding i'm an only child so she likes having me around which is good because she's in her late she's in her later stage of her life she's eighty two years old and and so she needs to uh i guess it's good that in in in it's own way maybe fate has taken place because you know eh someone eighty two years old by themselves in a huge house is not a good thing but with me there i think she feels <fe> there's a comfort level she feels with me there especially being her only child probably the most guilty i feel about anything are are the things that i did to hurt my marriage um as far as um the things that i did the selfish things that i did when i was much younger that um obviously affected the relationship between myself and my wife uh yeah i um got caught up in a situation where um i was working tremendous amounts of hours under a lotta stress my wife was also working a lotta hours in a job that she had and uh we were growing apart and um when she was away my form of release was to go uh to the casinos and gamble and so you know i spent a lot of time in in the casinos and what eventually happened was i spent a lot of money and obviously that was a major issue regarding our relationship had to do with trust because um it it was devastating to my wife i felt uh when <whe> when it when it came to light um i felt very guilty and i felt less than a human being at that point in my life no not at all no not really no i don't have problems sleeping that's i i don't ever recall having any problem sleeping so no no not at all no uh i well i just <deep breath> the only thing i could say is um after i had my heart attack a few years ago um i don't let i find myself not letting the small details or small things in life bother me as much as they did before so i tend to be a little bit more easygoing and my friends and family have noticed that the last time i felt really happy um probably when i had a visit with my cardiologist after my heart attack and um he basically said to me that after many tests and many uh months of uh rehabilitation that he was happy to explain to me that there was no scar tissue no major scar tissue that had occurred with my heart because of my heart heart attack and that um i could count on living a pretty much normal life as long as i watched my diet and took my medications well i guess number one thing is uh my physical being itself i like to be a little bit more healthier lose some more weight um just in general just be more healthier physically and as far as mentally um just not go back to those ways of thinking where i was doing the wrong things instead of the right things and not to be so selfish just one day at a time you know i just uh try to be at peace with my myself and try to have some peace of mind on a daily basis i meditate i read you know i read some books i watch t_v i i do things that i know that um if i can i if i can help myself i do things to help myself well there's a lot that i regret obviously in my marriage uh my uh working career as far as i had a long career with this majors uh food chain and and i basically because of my gambling issues i ended up ruining a a very good career but um at this point right now there's not much i can do i can't change what's been done so i don't focus too much on the past i just look at what's in front of me and just focus on what's in front of me eh every day what advice <laughter> wake up and see <s> and see what you're doing to yourself and you know make the changes that need to be changed um you know <kno> uh you know i'm not a uh i'm not someone that's not intelligent but i was intelligent enough to know what's right from wrong and um scrubbed_entry you're what you're doing is wrong you need to change your behavior immediately probably the proud <pro> what i'm proud about overall is the fact that um i did all these awful things but deep down i don't think as a person i'm a bad person i have to remember that um when i was caught up in all the gambling and compulsive behavior it was because i had an illness a compulsive uh obsessive compulsive behavior that made me ill and um that i was a sick person just trying to become healthy and every day that's what my life is about it's about recovery and uh just making sure that uh i do the right things from the time i wake up in the morning to the time i go to sleep at night one day at a time it's not as hard as you think it's but it is a process where you need to be diligent about your behavior and your routines and um just know that what's not right for you you know it could be okay for other people to do certain things but i cannot do those things anymore um most of my best friends can uh describe me as probably easygoing generous um a nice person to be around and um you know they were obviously a little shocked when they found out of all my issues uh related to the gambling and the my and the break-up of break-up of my marriage which you know it's still not over yet you know well my ideal weekend starts off usually um after i have breakfast with my mother early in the morning like around six o'clock um i go to a local park and uh it's about this park is probably laid out where you can walk up a hill and down a hill it's about three and a half miles and i take a brisk walk in the morning um get my blood flowing and get my heart rate going and then after that i um you know go home um work in the yard a few hours take a shower and relax and then just uh kinda kick back for the rest of the day and then the the the next day i i do the same thing again in the morning i go for a walk work out in the yard watch t_v whatever just relax that's how a weekend goes for me and thank you bye 
<synch> i am i feel pretty good i'm wide awake i had an good breakfast and a nice cup of coffee and uh i have an easy day today so i am just gonna chat with you then i'm going to the gym and run some errands so i plan on having a nice day today i was born and raised in los angeles and i'm one of the few locals from around here and uh i went to school away and uh but i'm one of the few natives that are actually in los angeles yes i am i like the weather having owned a vacation house in another state that i found to be too hot and humid in florida i love the weather here um i like the culture i like the diversity i like the familiarity i like that beaches uh but i also like that just an hour and a half away one can go to the desert say palm springs palm desert but also another hour and a half two hours away you can go to arrowhead or big bear and go snowboarding or skiing or things like that and uh i think it's a great place to live thank you well more of some maybe some of the things i don't like about l_a or say california in general say like the high tax rate which the state tax rate is up to thirteen point something now which is gonna chase business out of here also the regulations i'm a small business owner so all the regulations are clearly affecting business so many of my peers have moved their businesses to texas arizona nevada etcetera some of the other western states that are less regulated and uh that's a big problem here in uh uh california it really does most people don't understand it but  it's uh also uh you know besides the high taxes you know there's a big immigration problem which being born and raised here most people don't see that but it's a big tax on the social service system and that's what makes our taxes uh so high until they really secure the borders and get that taken care of so that's you know but people don't seem to want to really deal with uh deal with that but it clearly affects businesses because from all the other things that's why our taxes are so high and people are moving out of state i enjoy traveling i've been to sixty six countries and uh i don't travel as much as i used to but i've traveled quite a bit and i've learned a couple of languages and uh i served i'm sorry uh i didn't really understand uh your question when you said like what i don't think you understood what i said but i'll just go back and i've been all through europe eastern europe asia south america north africa um and i enjoy that and enjoy warm climates now especially where you can go and relax and there's warm water to surf 'cause the cold water kind of makes my back stiffen up and i also like to exercise and surf and do yoga and work out and uh i try to eat healthy and uh that's a big part of my life oh sure um one of my favorite trips of all time was i used to when i was younger see how many countries i could do in a relatively short period of time say in a three or four week span but about ten years ago we actually went to paris and stayed for about a week and really got to know the city even though i'd been there about ten times we got to know the city really well which was great really lived like a local and rented a small flat and cooked and did our own shopping but really having been there so many times i really never stayed for more than three or four days it was fun to stay there for about you know almost a month and uh really get to learn the city and it was fun even though i grew up in l_a i grew up taking french which there wasn't a big spanish speaking population when i when i was younger my mother insisted that all of us kids take french even though spanish would've been a lot more valuable but i took french uh all through uh elementary junior high and uh high school so it was nice to practice my french even though i don't remember a whole lot and even though i stopped speaking french with the french you know and my accent is not the greatest so after a couple sentences they start talking english to me <laughter> so that was a uh i have a few different degrees so uh i was a naval science major as an undergraduate and uh that was fun and i also have a masters uh degree in economics and i have a degree in crisis management so uh i found them um interesting and uh it was something that i wanted to do where i went to college i went to the naval academy i went there to play sports and  i found it real interesting being from southern california going to school in maryland and i originally wanted to be a doctor but once you start going to school for a little bit you change your mind etcetera so um i'm actually in the wholesale business now for wholesale distributors of furniture products and it was a family business but i went to work there a number of years ago well you know my grandfather and recently father passed away so i sort of run a eighty year old family business and it's pretty interesting i like it having grown up around it but it's different than other jobs i've had in the past hm actually probably my dream job i think cooking and staying at home this fun i've changed so much i enjoy cooking and staying at home and uh uh i would probably like to stay home and raise kids because i do have one daughter and uh you know didn't get to spend as much time with her when she was younger as i would've liked but i think i would be better than say a lot of women i know  that want to work i actually like cooking and hanging around the house and taking care of kids you know that i like doing i'm always on a part time basis but do that having pretty much worked most of my life it seems like boy that would be fun to stay home and uh do that having pretty much worked most of my life so probably never happen but it sounds something that to me would be fun uh i think i'm um generally more reserved and shy with strangers but when i get to know someone or feel comfortable i think i'm more of an extrovert whereas most strangers might think i'm more introverted but i think i'm when i feel comfortable with certain people and i don't know what it is i can meet a stranger and  be totally confident or people that i might've known for years either from a personal or a business situation and be more um introverted i mean i just i just go with the dynamics but i think my outward manifestation is to be a little more shy in general and reserved <reser> i use like to use the term reserved oh wow that's a great idea i used to have that on uh one of my i have uh several computers at home and that used to be one of my screensavers uh as well i usually tend when when i need to relax or had a stressful day or stressful personal events or going for a long walk or going for a long walk or going for a long walk i usually find exercise whether it be yoga or going for a long walk or going to the gym or going for a run or going to the beach you know maybe going surfing when the weather's warm i don't surf in cold weather anymore because it makes it gives me like a brain freeze even though i've surfed for you know over thirty years i had it uh i usually find exercise helps me relax the best or sometimes just vegging out on the couch in front of the t_v i find very relaxing <laughter> but i like that screensaver i used to have that on one of my uh screensavers at home but yes that was uh that was it but that's one of the things that took me a number of years to master though were my relaxation skills i probably didn't have them the best in my twenties but over the years i think i've gotten better uh at the i think that's a key thing and i think as we mature as we learn how to do that i wish i'd learned how to do that and be a little more how do you had had the skills earlier i like to think i'm pretty good i think i'm a lot better as well as that as i've aged um you know i i am more likely to think before i speak now whereas say twenty years ago i was more likely to act before i fought so i might've said more things that i in a whatever tense situation whether it be personal or a work situation um but i've never had a a a violent temper but i would have a temper where i fly off the handle instead of taking a deep breath and reflecting on it i think i'm a lot better at that  now than i was say in my teens or twenties so when i think a lot of that comes i think the keyword there is maturity oh wow you know i haven't really had an argument with anybody in several years <y> what i would consider a traditional argument um probably um my ex wife a number of years ago wehad an argument basically just over my daughter and it wasn't anything violent but it was heated just basically one of the reasons we didn't weren't married our values were so different just our ideas of parenting and uh just uh outlook on life was so different i think that caused us to butt heads but it was just i don't know if i'd call it an argument but it was more of just a uh one of those let's agree to disagree butt heads so i felt like i was talking to a wall and i actually felt more mad at myself that i should've learned earlier in life that boy that before you get married to someone have children with them that's the kind of discussions that people should usually have but you're not really thinking of that because sometimes when we're younger we're looking at boy how does that i look great on paper to her and she looked great on paper to me but you know i'm pretty easy going and i have different ideas on raising children how she did and that was more not that she was wrong and i was right not that i was right and she was wrong it was just how we were raised and our just different views and we never really discussed those things but it was really just fundamental reasons why we butted heads and more weren't really a good match whereas other things looked good you know on paper to both of us hm there's one recently my father passed away uh recently thank you and really because in our religion you know you plan a funeral very quickly you know typically within a couple of days and i really only invited very very close friends and family members i was more or less in charge of it my dad was remarried but his widow was sort of not really up to it so i took care of it and i wish i had invited a i kept it very private and really just told people after the fact that he knew that would've liked to have come tp the service had they known about it so i really only invited because just the time pressure really just a handful of people but now as time's passed i wish i'd invited more of his friends instead of just two or three close friends you know ten or twenty acquaintances and people he knew from business or over the years and i really just and even distant family members i really just told after the fact i really didn't invite them because i was under a time pressure but i could've easily done it via email or it's hard to call everybody personally but i wish that's something 'cause people have expressed a little they were upset with me when my other family members threw it all back at me oh you didn't tell me 'til after the fact that you know so and so had passed so they all threw it at me because i was more or less doing it so i wish i i did that differently but i did the best i could at the time so i'm not really mad at myself about something i probably should've been more prepared for also something <s s something> that was coming was inevitable so um well both my parents are recently uh deceased in the last couple of years and i had a brother that i have three younger brothers one of who passed away in december and we're not super close like i always like i look at other families we were just never like that norman rockwell uh painting i guess we're also uh different and uh i have a close relationship with friends and a more distant relationship with family not that it's strange but i wish it was more like boy one of those families that got together every sunday and had dinner and all that we just never did that because we're all all so uh uh different yeah it's yeah just being that's how it is but you know to strangers and most people i just say you know howdy the family everybody's great you know but i think every family has their own sort of stuff um no but i thought probably i could've had it before from some other events in my life and i just wasn't sure i've had been to some therapy in the past just from you know uh i was in the military and i was never really sure if that that's exactly what it was but i think i function pretty well but i just wasn't sure that i had been to some therapy and counseling over the years i didn't enlist i was an officer i went to one of the service academies that um seventeen i started when after high school and i went to a service academy so it's more prestige it just isn't enlisting it's the hard where i went it's the hardest school in america to get into i was but same age as everybody else that went there uh we did nineteen eighty three um just basically wasn't anything intense it was just we were just around some we were just we weren't allowed to carry ammunition we were just our position were just shelled at the time and poison gas was sprayed on us so that was a it wasn't it wasn't anything too uh too intense it was a lot you know because it the service i was in the training was way more intense than any actual combat situation that's because they train you well it's like you practice harder than you play if you're an athlete if you play football you practice harder than you you actually play in the game and the same with uh you know if you're in a combat unit well it made me more patriotic having grown up in california whereas people who are from all over the country and i got to meet whereas most of say my friends who grew up in affluent los angeles like i did never really went out and met a lot of americans and people from different backgrounds and i ended up becoming uh just more patriotic and a deeper sense of pride in the country whereas you really don't grow up with that in southern california whereas someone in texas or kentucky or tennessee or georgia north dakota south dakota montana grows up with that kind of uh pride so i thought it was good and it unlike so many of my friends that they don't know any there's any life between malibu and manhattan uh i went to graduate i was still in the reserves but i went to graduate school and i got two graduate degrees and i went to work in private enterprise uh didn't care for it then i joined the fire department i was a fire fighter and paramedic for a number of years and then after i got divorced it was harder to do the custody situation with my daughter so i went to work in a family business and that's pretty much my career in a nutshell um at first it was because i had such a bearing in my butt from the way i walked i talked and again i was an officer uh you were very regimented on the way you dressed in your private time it was harder took me awhile to be able to come back to los angeles uh because it was just so uh so different i think i handled it better than most i have a stronger personality so but it was a great experience um it all depends if i exercise regularly and i don't eat too late and things are going well in my life i generally sleep pretty well even though i might have to get up and go to the bathroom once during the night um but i generally sleep uh i generally sleep pretty well i feel pretty good lately you know i've been like anybody else more periods of blue in your life but boy the last few months i feel great pretty much no not really i seem i think i seem a little happier more content lately um i've had thought maybe in the past because i do have a family history of it and you know it wasn't anything real too debilitating and i wasn't able to really function on my own but i was concerned with it and sought counseling i do i was really against it in the past and until after i went i mean i wish i went more say during my uh my marriage over the course of uh my life now i think it's very useful however in the past i was one of those i grew up hearing that it was just ridiculous and it was a waste of money etcetera but i think it's a useful tool if you're open to it oh just some questions i wanted just an honest opinion outside of friends or strangers from a professional you know about life relationships and sometimes it's good talking things out with a a professional even though i wouldn't see someone like you in real life i prefer someone who's older than i am a little more life experience than someone who's maybe younger so but yeah i think it's a useful tool and i really did a hundred and eighty degree switch on that uh i don't go now i'm sorta taking a break from it but i'm not against it if i have some issues i wanna bounce off i do have someone that i go to yeah i think it's nice you know they really if you go to someone who's good and again i've been to a few different people and sort of therapist shopped they really don't tell you what to think which i think is great you know that's always in the past they just help you talk through your your thoughts and your feelings and let you decide for yourself but bring a little clarity to the situation that's why i like talking to someone who has a lot more life experience and i generally feel more comfortable talking to a woman about that stuff than say to a man so but it's um i think it's a a useful tool i got some good ideas and was able to it's nice balancing some things off totally someone who's unbiased and not in your day to day life instead of talking to a a romantic partner or a close friend who knows you but sometimes bouncing the people off of strangers is good uh this morning i know this this is weird but i'm clearly someone and i'd say this as a joke to my friends and family and associates i clearly have i'm having an easy day today 'cause i knew we're having nice weather and i have a bunch of errands to run and i clearly have seasonal affective disorder but i woke up so happy today when i know it's gonna be eighty degrees out and when the weather's nice i'm generally a lot more happier than when the weather's [laughter] dark and blue and rainy and cold where i always i know that term so but i'm just well i woke up really happy today because i knew it's gonna be a nice day and i looked forward to feeling the sun so uh most of my friends i'm sort of a renaissance man i know a little bit about a lot of subjects i'm too smart for my own good and i'm a i know a a lot a lot of permeable things i'm pretty rational i'm very resourceful people always call me when they have issues and i help talk them through it or i'm resourceful and tell them where to go whether it's where to buy a new computer or buy a new car or you know i'm great with medical diagnoses uh and uh you know people also say i'm a lot of fun i'm fun to be with and um i also have i don't have a lot of grey areas people will either really like me or don't like me with me things are pretty much black and white i am what i am i don't b_s you know i'm the opposite of a politician so i don't tell people what they want to hear i don't be rude not rude to anybody but i pretty much call things as i see them so that's pretty much no not really 'cause i do everything tactfully i like to think i do uh probably just i probably spent more time with my parents before they passed but i was busy uh i probably wish i was able to spend more time with my daughter when she was younger uh but just a lot of it's very typical really to think things through a little bit more be a little less impulsive or have pretended to be more impulsive when i was younger than i am now i think that's that's it and i would look at things in the long term instead of looking in things in the short term you know when you make decisions or choices um i'm proud of my daughter she's a nice young lady i am uh proud of my public service i've never done a job really for money of my military service and fire service um there are very few people like me who did it who are as had the background in education that i did but i like public service and um so i'm proud of uh that  proud of all the certificates i have hanging on my walls at home and degrees sort of like trophies i'm proud that i've been able to stay in good physical shape over the years and knock wood maintain good health it was nice meeting you bye bye thank you 
<synch> yeah i'm great and you uh los angeles california uh <sigh> i like the diversity i feel l_a by itself is a country there's so much to do so much to explore and uh there's nothing like it traffic <laughter> uh i would say traffic and the real estate prices are kinda crazy compared to the rest of the country but other than that then you know it's fine i have traveled um i have traveled a bit um i would like to travel more though so but i've traveled to i've been to a few countries um i've been to i won't say europe that's a continent um i've been to uh london <deep breath> um i was born here but my family's from nigeria so i've been to nigeria a few times i've been to denmark um amsterdam i've been to uh where else have i gone uh germany um and i think that's i think that's it yeah think that's it yeah just exploring uh exploring <exp> exploring new places um seeing new things meeting new people a different culture it's definitely um um gives you an appreciation for life and the diversity of it and also um going to countries that may not be as developed as the u_s it definitely it definitely gives you a greater appreciation of you know this country yeah okay well <sigh> uh let's see london i accident actually when i first heard about going to london i really didn't care for it 'cause i didn't know much about it the only i thing i remember <mem> i remember is watching mary poppins <laughter> and um but um when i went there i absolutely fell in love with it um just <deep breath> it still <sti> it has the hustle and bustle of l_a but at the same time you can go at a very very slow pace um we didn't do any driving we just went on the tube um which is their like the underground subway station which i absolutely fell in love with and um just exploring um different parts of the city we went to you know big ben westminster abbey uh they actually had when i went there they had the premiere of um what movie was this um slumdog millionaire and also they had the premiere for um seven seven pounds it was a movie with will smith um they did so will smith was over there and we were you know me and my friends were like kinda like screaming like we were like groupies <laughter> just you know just <laughter> just <laughter> just to you know for antics but um yeah it was it was a lot of fun it was a lot of fun yeah uh business management and an option in human resources management what that means i have no idea <laughter> um good question i've always i've always wanted to go into business um and i've always wanted to study finance but i didn't think i would learn too much about finance from college per se i think i've learned more in the real world whatnot so the other option was human resource and i'm always fascinated about you know relationships and people always like reading articles about that stuff so i went for that no <laughter> well i still i still kinda use what i've learned but i i work in property management so um it still has to do with people anything to do with people i'm fascinated about so yeah <laughter> that was a good one um my dream job wow i would say being a life coach i would uh yeah i would say that would my dream job because i love helping people become successes and i help i love being a part of someone else's success even no regardless of how small it is um whether it be words of encouragement or helping somebody figure out a situation i like um i just help <hel> like helping people have a better life so i think uh you know but i do it for free i'd do it for free like all day yeah yeah more outgoing definitely more outgoing i'm usually um the life well it's it's weird 'cause i'm usually considered like the life of the party i'm the one who's cracking jokes and making everybody laugh at the same time i can be very very quiet and to myself so yeah <laughter> right <sigh> to relax i usually listen to music i usually listen to music to relax me or i pray to to relax myself or listen to some really calm music so yeah very good very very good i used to uh i wouldn't say it was a bad temper but i was known to um go off quote on quote <laughter> not in a not in a you know not throwing chairs or anything like that but i'm a very very patient person but once that patience <patien> is gone and for you to do that you have to really really really really push my buttons for a long time and once it's done i i just go off no mm mm no <sigh> the last time i argued with someone <some> wow i haven't argued with somebody in a long time um <sigh> boy mm uh i argued with my no i would say my i think it my dad i argued with him um about <sigh> xxx what was it about um we were disagreeing on some things about when we were gonna supposed to go back to nigeria and he wasn't listening to it was a kind of like a group discussion myself and my my siblings and he was being very subjective he wasn't being open to other people's suggestions and suggestions and concerns so um it started an argument uh very uh i wouldn't say angry per se but i felt very kinda like i was losing control like um i'm the type where i i like to be in control of my emotions and of my thoughts and i feel once that patience is gone and i start going off it's kinda like this this uh you know i won't call it a blur but i'm very witty and quick with what i say so i will instantly say something that you know up not necessarily hurtful but um very direct and to the point and i make sure i get my point across yeah um i have three brothers one one younger two older i'm very close with my family and my mom is one of my best friends um <sigh> my brothers are great um love 'em to death uh my father eh he's moreso out of the picture yeah <deep breath> hmm <sigh> i don't i don't really i'm not the guilty type <laughter> i don't feel guilty i'm not one to shy away from what i've done and i definitely own up to what i do i'm not one to shy away from responsibility but i don't think i ever feel guilty for anything i do yeah i don't think i feel i i usually don't feel guilty yeah <deep breath> pretty pretty easy um pretty easy at <a> at yeah i'm pretty good at falling asleep except when i'm excited and when i'm reading <laughter> when i'm trying to when i'm when i'm focused on learning something like i'll read and read and read even when it's past my bed time but now i'm trying to work on waking up much earlier then when i am now and that's kind of a struggle <st> a little bit of a struggle but i'm getting to it so good um i've been feeling i've been feeling fine you know i'm generally i have a very very happy disposition and so no uh you know deep depressing moods nothing like that and whenever if i feel do feel like i'm going i don't allow myself to go to that place nah no sorry <sigh> mm <sigh> thoughts i would say well <we> it's i wouldn't say necessarily changes but i'd say moreso behaviors learning how to let go of past decisions maybe and kinda how they they played their course in my life um i just sometimes i kinda look back and say what if i did this what would've how would life be now no so the those are some games i play but other than that that's it hmm <laughter> regret uh no no mm mm there isn't anything i regret <sigh> ten to twenty years ago i would say don't be afraid of who you are um be authentic um more importantly with yourself hmm erase from my memory uh boy that's a good one <sigh> hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm uh wow erase from my memory uh i would say when i told <t> when i told my dad that he should act like a father maybe i shouldn't yeah there was um that was actually one of the times i <laughter> another time i went off usually with him um uh basically i had decided not to go to a private um not to go away for college um so <s> i went <we> i decided to stay local so i can look after my little brother and um <sigh> my senior year i was overloading with everything i had maybe like uh four a_p classes i was working at i was working three jobs at the time and i was also in track and field so needless to say i was <laughter> i i i i was kinda like burning myself i was kinda like burning myself out and um i wasn't doing well in a_p calculus because i decided to go to a j_c first and transfer also to save money for college too and when i told him you know the teacher called saying i was falling asleep in class um just because mind you after school i'd work an eight hour shift 'cause i was a retail manager at the time so um and i'd come home after that shift to do homework mm calculus let alone um so uh um he would get upset and i told him i spoke with my counselor i already told him that i don't need that class to go to the j_c isn't something that i continue with so i'm just gonna i can't drop out at that point in time so i'm just gonna you know you know just just take the d or fail whatever and he didn't he didn't like that 'cause he is a teacher <laughter> i think maybe that's what maybe where it came from he's a teacher as well um and so he started blaming like my jobs and wanting to call my boss and it was it was just too much and i told him you know since you're my father you should act like it but i was it was a more aggressive <laughter> way i said it so that was um one thing oh i actually i do i i do remember i do regret one thing um and that is i wish i continued um with college throughout like i i burnt myself out um i was spreading myself too thin there was actually i was actually on track to graduate from college at i wanna say nineteen 'cause i started taking college classes in high school starting sophomore year in high school but i with that that stuff and the stuff with my dad and working i just kinda like stopped going to school for a while and just worked but i went back to finish so but i wish i just would've continued maybe that's one small thing but that's something small though yeah hmm i'm very um i'm a very compassionate and understanding person um i like learning new things um i'm a very very happy person people come to me for advice i'm very objective i'll tell you the good the bad the ugly and um yeah those are some of my best qualities yeah and i'm fun i like to have fun i'll have fun in any situation i can make light of any situation like i'm the kinda type <ty> type of person i can break the tension in the room that's sort of that sort of uh <tisk> um personality trait yeah wish i was taller <laughter> um uh besides my height hmm i wish ah maybe i don't know if it's uh be more i won't say be more in touch with my emotions but i think i would say understanding people's how people feel about me in their shoes i think that would be one thing because i'm the type of person where people say that they love me or care about me and i'm like okay great thank you i appreciate that but i don't realize how much they do i think that's a realizing how much they care and love me that's one thing i would like to get more of a grasp on <laughter> my best friend <deep breath> uh she describes me as someone who's funny crazy um objective um loyal um ambitious hardworking um mean <laughter> when i just make jokes she says you're so mean but um just <sigh> i just i <laughter> i i just like to i joke around all the time and so um we were right now we're actually planning um uh a friend of mine or a friend of ours um a baby shower i'm giving her some ideas and there's another friend who was invited who we had some issues in the past and someone i don't talk to or hang out with we used to be really close but i don't really talk to that person but i don't mind them being there so she also talked about having <havi> celebrating her birthday also at kinda like after the baby shower and there is another friend whose birthday was before the baby shower who we really <rea> didn't do anything for and i'm like well if we're celebrating this person's birthday might as well we should definitely you know honor this person's birthday as well since we're closer to you know the person xxx birthday's passed and i said you know what just why <wh> don't we celebrate everybody's birthday <laughter> forget the baby shower just do the birthdays and then <laughter> that's when that's when she said you're so mean <laughter> but she was laughing about it so yeah yeah uh <sigh> most proud of in my in my life <deep breath> uh <sigh> i would say being there for my family being being a a mentally and emotionally strong person family's gone through a lot of challenges and a lotta times i've been the one to make sure everything goes okay and everything make sure <su> everything <everythi> make sure everything goes accordingly um so i'd say more than anything making sure i was there for my family yeah oh okay thank you bye have a good one 
<synch> <sniffle> yeah i'm okay with it um i'm okay i'm okay um i guess scrubbed_entry i'm basically an l_a kinda guy cool um you know the weather it's usually pretty sunny and and temperate you know i like the the climate really a lot uh i like the girls here you know um i like uh let's see i don't like the traffic you know but um i like the hispanic population quite a bit you know um and i have a lot of friends here so i guess you know i don't wanna be anywhere else i mean like i said the traffic you know i was on the four o five you know that's always kinda you know crummy the cost of living that's really you know terrible about l_a it's always expensive and um you know i really don't like <sigh> i really don't like you know the the like it just seems like um l_a's one of those places where like you're you know you either have like a a you know a ton of money and fame and fortune or like you know you're down in the you know the ghettos you know i have i've been to a couple places um uh you know but very brief you know mostly it was for school um i went to arizona and new york and montana lot of the anthropology like you know and archaeology field trips and things like that um nothing i'm doing in right now uh i like getting away from um <laughter> the city you know i was in yosemite last year you know in the summer for vacation that was kinda nice you know yosemite was really um really neat to see but uh just basically getting away from the city i guess you know getting away from the job getting away from um the stress here uh i actually studied political science and i also studied economics um i'm a big kind of a political you know junkie you know to begin with so i naturally kinda fell in line with that kinda field of study i was i was but i lost my job and you know that's kind of a bummer you know um i lost it's uh geez it's already been maybe a year and a half by now maybe two years and um you know the economy uh got bad and the budget cuts got bad and you know um i wish i was working there again uh <laughter> well i um wanted to be a lawyer at one time i wanted to be a lawyer and i um and that's why i took political science and i took a double major in economics and uh the sad thing is the sad thing i i regret is i eh you know to get into law school you have to take this entrance exam called the lsats and i studied for it like really hardcore you know for about a year and i took the xxx test and like a idiot um i didn't feel right about the that day it was kind of an off day and you know it was like you know the big game at the superbowl you <y> you know i just um i don't <do> i don't feel like i did well and i canceled the test and so um you know i kinda regret that you know <laughter> tell me about it um i'm not really shy at all i'm definitely not shy um but outgoing i mean not one of these people <peo> i'm not flamboyent you know um i i'll talk to people i don't mind talking to people i don't mind um meeting <mee> meeting people that's fine with me but it's not like i'm you know dying to to dying to meet anybody <laughter> you know <laughter> i guess um these days uh you know i play guitar you know i taught myself how to play guitar um uh yeah thank you thank you i you know i i should've i should actually be doing more of it but i also like to exercise um uh i'm on a diet right now but my diet's been terrible time the eating habits have been terrible but the exercise part is just great i love to exercise <exerci> i love to run that's one of my best things to do for stress is like run and like work out um i just wish that my eating habits were were in line uh or a little bit better you know <sniffle> um <sigh> my temper could be you know definitely improved uh a lot you know um you know a lotta times i i feel i'm one of these introvert types persons when it comes to like you know i don't mind being extrovert or like meeting people and like having a good time whatever when uh when i'm mad i really don't wanna be you know talking to people i don't like to yell i don't like to scream i don't like to hit i don't like to fight i kinda close down a lot i don't i just wanna be left alone sometimes i tend to drag it on for longer than it should be you know uh the wife doesn't like it too much and maybe i you know i just don't i just don't wanna talk about it <laughter> i just don't wanna deal with it i kinda close down and shut you know shut off for a little bit geez um you know it doesn't happen too often maybe with my wife you know we were probably something silly who knows who knows um the thing i i mean i don't have a lotta guilt i don't do anything like to make me ever feel like you know that bad of a person you know um there are things that like you know um i call minor sins you know i get white lies or whatever you know but like nothing like so atrocious that makes me feel like guilty um let's see i guess sometimes you know um you know i i'm a married guy but i you know sometimes there are times you know i like to you know smile at a girl or like you know get a girl's attention you know i don't know i never go i never do anything about it i never get their phone number or like you know but sometimes i like to like talk to people i guess you know well that's a good question i guess i guess you know see i always handle it the same there's not i don't ever wish to ever to ever change i i never wanna like handle things differently i always kinda i'm pretty comfortable the way i handle things and you know i think that um i could be a lot worse and like you know shouting and screaming and hitting and this and that and that's just not me um you know i think the best thing to do you know is kinda like get a lot of breathing room a lotta space and um i don't wish for that to change or to handle any of that differently i just don't basically know what else to do you know um and you know the last thing i wanna do is start talking about you know feelings or any of this you know that's the last thing i wanna do and so like i don't wish that i handle things like that differently in that way well um you know i'm pretty happy with my family right now um you know if i'm married and we have a baby along the way which is kinda nice um we have some cats thank you thank you we have cats and a dog a weenie dog and um my mom i i love my mom dearly um uh she has diabetes which you know she doesn't control you know she doesn't control it and like it like uh it affects her health and it always has me worried about her and like stressing out about her and and she could do so much to like prevent it and she doesn't and um you know i have a good relationship with my mom i i love her dear dearly and i actually have a good relationship with everybody i think i think i have a ton <to> ton of of family and friends um that get along with me pretty well actually you know yeah um <sigh> there are times well i mean it's pretty easy for me to go to sleep actually i i feel like you know i sleep like a baby um the only problem i have i think is i feel like um you know sometimes like you fall asleep and you have you you're just going to sleep and you kinda like jolt you know like you almost kinda like fall eh it's like a falling sensation or something like that and it doesn't happen eh that often but it happens and um but for the most time <ti> part um no i sleep like a rock i sleep really good <sniffle> well right now generally i've been feeling um worried and and anxious and um you know uh and tense and the reason why is 'cause i said my mom um right well at least today well i found out my mom something she didn't tell me the whole story and i'm kinda waiting 'til this is over so we can i can find out what's wrong with her but um you know i'm worried about her she's in the hospital <ho> she's in the doctors right now so that doesn't tell me anything good and um you know um trying to find a job so that has me worried too and you know the baby along the way so that has me worried so i feel like <sharp inhale> you know overwhelmed with a just a lotta like you know things to do and like and um a lot on my a lot on my plate and like a lot of it doesn't have anything to do with me but i have to handle it like you know so like i guess well um i keep myself distracted i keep myself busy i i feel like a busybody you know and the more um which kinda seems <se> you know seems like it's not a good thing because i feel like i'm just adding more things on my plate so um you know like one of the things i do is like exercise and so i have to work out every day you know but that takes an hour that takes an hour to like you know change <ch> change and you just start running and like go through the whole thing of stretching and and cooling down that takes it takes some time and then like to shower all that kinda stuff takes <ta> takes time so but i have to do it daily so i cope with it in that way i also cope with it too you know playing guitar but that just more of a distraction you know what i mean keeping you know keeping busy that way it just seems like it's not you know um working towards you know the goals you know that i need to do like you know finding <f> finding a job which i should be doing but then um you know it's one of those things where like i find like there's no good jobs i've been looking and looking and like sometimes when i do it it it's just not what i wanna do it just doesn't seem like <laughter> like i wanna like uh do any of these like terrible jobs i xxx it's you know it's it's probably harder than i'm thinking about it because sometimes i i i feel like um you know one of these things is like uh i feel like um it is hard but it's not i mean there are ways i can cope with it you know i just gotta kinda i kind of accepted it a lot you know i kinda internalized it and like uh you know it's not something that's like i'm not out on the streets or anything like that <laughter> but uh you know it is a worry i've never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i used to work with no no <grumble> man <sigh> uh ten years ago <laughter> i don't know uh let's see the last time i was really happy maybe i mean nothing i feel like nothing makes me happy no more you know um i learned a new song on the guitar feel <fe> i i feel like not even happy about that you know i feel like um you know i work sometimes and that kinda makes me happy you know running like you know fast and working out but that doesn't make me so excited or anything like that it just makes me feel good you know so i i have these these these times where i'm just you know feeling good about myself and i'm feeling you know but i'm never feeling great i'm never feeling happy i'm never feeling like so sensationalized like you know and and and uh you know incredible that you know um it just eh you know there's these there's these mild times where there's a a few good times you know and a few bad times but the good times are no never <n> never <ne> never extremes you know never really good times and never really you know atrocious bad times you know well i wish this diet would work out a little bit better you know but that's kinda hard you know 'cause i'm the kinda guy who just likes who just likes you know um you know rice and and like uh mexican food and like <sharp inhale> you know um and to snack and uh i don't know um i just feel like that could i could change i wish i could change my eating habits that way i can like you know 'cause i work out so much i feel like i do so much running and so much activity that like um you know that if i got my you know diet in check um you know that that would um go a long way um i wish i also can change you know um my <m> my my uh i guess my my desire to like you know get ahead like right now i feel just so um like the economy's so bad and like things are so um rough that you know it's like pointless to even like you know look for these kinda jobs so like it just seems like i just wish i had a little bit more inspiration a lot more motivation to like to um <laughter> <sigh> do things <sniffle> the one thing i regret is is not is not um you know is this this lsat thing you know um you know not uh uh canceling the test to begin with 'cause i'm sure i could've got into a a school but then again like you know it has me thinking like do i really wanna pay a bunch of like you know law school tuition and the cost of that and like you know just to um just to be piled on with more work and things like that eh i don't know <sigh> it just doesn't seem like like uh i mean there is a this idea of justice and and um and republicanism and you know things that i really you know adhere to that um i fall in love with and that i don't wanna get away from but it just seems like it's a like it's a ton of work and money and just to like um it for the smalls percentage of success that that you know you might not be really doing that kinda field you might you know i might <mi> it just doesn't seem like like um it's worth overcoming the obstacles i need to overcome ugh <sigh> i have no idea i would <laughter> i would <wou> twenty years ago i would tell myself maybe um you know i think i've done everything really well for myself except for the the lsat thing you know which i i you know regret on one hand on the other hand you know i i'm not sure if i regret 'cause like eh about the bills and all that kinda stuff i told you about and you know i think uh you know i i've waited to get married i waited to have a kid i've i've you know pretty cautious about the decisions <deci> you know i don't take drugs i don't drink i don't fight i don't do any of these like things that like you know that i think that real people have you know um and then they they really like you know ruin their life you know so like i'm pretty happy and content with being you know the cautious you know uh <sigh> i don't know oh my best friend i think he he kinda like <li> he likes me he wishes that i would do more things with him but he works at night and and you know it's one of those things i think most people not just my best friend but my wife and might be but rest of my family feel that i don't put a lot of time and attention to them i mean they think that i'm pretty great when i do give 'em the my time of day and my attention but um i don't know if i'm really there all the time you know i don't know if i'm really you know i'm always thinking about something else i'm always thinking about something different i don't <don> i don't know if i really can give 'em eh a a real you know shoulder to cry on or you know if they ask for something you know i'll i'll usually do it you know but i almost feel like it's like a chore like you know like if they you know if they really need me then i'll do it you know eh if they're just asking for a favor i almost feel you know i do it half you know with a lotta lackluster lotta half-heartedness i just feel <f> and it's not because i hate 'em or anything i really like 'em it's just that i feel like i almost i don't wanna say i owe it to them but the mere fact that i'm their friend makes them somehow um you know uh like i eh it it makes me like you know they rely on me some you know times or like i don't wanna let 'em down they are my friends but it's the same time i i just feel like it's it's more it's not it's not it's more of like a chore to do instead of a a willingness like a oh my god like i just wanna help you it's never <ne> it's never like that it's just something that i do because i have <ha> kinda have to you know you gotta you know gotta do things for your friends you know in the end because they're your friends you know and i in in the end i do like 'em and they probably would do it for me and i you know so i just do these things you know just um well there are a couple a things that i do like uh that i've good <go> i feel good about myself you know um you know i ran the l_a marathon that kinda feels good you know i've graduated from college that kinda feels good you know what i mean but the thing is i don't feel like like that proud of myself for you know those things alone like graduating from college you know hasn't really made me successful you know what i mean um running the marathon hasn't made me thin and trim so they're like half merits you know or like they're they're great you know lotta people maybe not half done it a lotta people have excelled further but um you know they're kinda like stepping stones that like that um i've seal real new no life <l> lifelong benefit from doing other than the fact that i can say that i've done yeah yeah no problem no problem thank you for your time you know um hope you enjoy you know uh being in this computer <laughter> oh goodbye i'm gonna press this button now 
<sync> <ellie starts> sure yeah i'm doing great thank you for asking um you know how about yourself <laughter> oh awesome uh i'm from guatemala my parents here migrated here to the united states when i was like three years old so yeah mhm yeah it's pretty cool you know uh i haven't been there actually i haven't been back to my hometown since forever uh just you know i have all my family here my mom my dad my cousins aunts uncle so practically i i have my my life here so i probably i mean it would be nice to visit but you know it just does my curiousity hasn't you know gone there i guess oh okay um i love the people everyone's nice i love the diversity you know there's different types of people and you know the imaginations out there everything is just great you know everyone's different you know no one's like the same at at least to some aspects um and i love the scenery i love the you know mountains they're beautiful you know great for hikes you know taking out you know the dog the family you know it's nice it's pretty active yeah uh the smog <laughter> uh i don't like the smog it's just you know if you go out um further out you know you could tell by the air you know or you know everything's clearer the sky is bluer <laughter> um but other than that like you know and traffic <laughter> nobody likes traffic i think yeah yeah but um yeah that's you know pretty much l_a is pretty nice you know it's i like it um well i was studying just basic you know um i'm not sure exactly what i wanna be so it's just kind of you know here and there just jumping through hoops and stuff so not really set yet it's just i'm still trying to find my interests i suppose so um my dream job hm that's a good one um i love working with children so i would say probably a child psychologist just 'cause you know it's great you know to learn what's going on in the young minds and you know how we could help children develop a better way you know make children you know or help you know help them you know grow up in a positive way i supposed instead of like going the wrong track yeah i just you know help children uh it depends it depends on the situation i'm in sometimes you know i could be like super outgoing and just like you know and sometimes like it just i could be all quiet or whatnot and just paying attention you know if i'm like in class or whatever i don't really like and there's everyone talking i just i'd prefer just to stay away from that you know 'cause i need something else to concentrate on something else you know there's like a moment and time for everything i suppose yeah um i like to kick my feet up on the couch and like read a good book you know just get my mind going to another you know galaxy or universe or situation you know it's pretty fun you know just you know reading and then just having just yourself relaxed and you know feeling good yeah it is it's just fun i love reading um i'm okay with it i'm not like the best you know temper controlling person there is out there you know i try my best and i guess that's all i could do until i keep doing better eventually but i'm not like the best i mean i sometimes i do have my outbursts you know um but you know i guess that's everyone i'm not sure haha you know uh huh that's a good question um hm i don't remember <laughter> uh let's see uh honestly i can't recall maybe uh my goodness i i don't know <laughter> i've i've uh sometimes i'm very passive that i'll just like let things go 'cause i mean what's the point of making a big deal out of things you know so um huh i don't know i'm not i i i can't honestly i can't tell you that <laughter> at this moment sure yeah probably come back to it um huh well i guess when i was younger i you know uh could've been better older sister and i i wasn't and that makes me feel guilty for sure you know i could've been a better sister better role model <laughter> you know but i'm trying my best now so i'm trying to make things better and it's working <laughter> yeah woo um i guess huh hm i don't know i mean i'm the person that i am because of the events that have happened in my life so if i erase something then it just there's something of me in my present self or you know that would change and i don't know i'm pretty okay with the person that i am now i mean you know i don't think i would change an event you know i'm i'm okay with what you know ups and downs and good and bad that has happened so yeah uh i can't see your shoes but um i don't travel a lot um but i am kind of like an explorer i guess i love to explore like even the smallest things like if i go hiking i go off trail and you know just find my way up to the top you know somehow some way and just make it you know um traveling uh i would love to do that but i don't know just you know always circumstances in my life that doesn't you know always something you know i'm getting married children you know and all this so it's kind of like you know it would be nice i guess you know it would be nice you know i love camping that's kind of like you know it's taking a few days trips out there camping and you know fishing <laughter> yeah um hm it was this summer you know me and my husband went camping and it was really nice it was just me and him you know and it was like no one and it was like beautiful because it was just in the middle of the woods with a beautiful lake and you know it was it was really nice it just yeah yeah yeah yeah it was it was it was really fun  it was like i would love to do it again you know right now it would be great you know just going out there it's just i love the adventure of things and the nature and just life and you know overall yeah uh it's it's easy but lately i haven't been able to sleep like at night right away because i don't know just you know just i'm laying there and i'm just like trying to go to sleep and i'm just like ugh but eventually i do <laughter> you know i just i probably like need to position myself on a different side of the bed like sometimes i'm i'm in the headboard and i'm like ah i gotta go to the other side and once i position myself then i just like go to sleep you know but it just i gotta find the position <pos> the right position for me yeah um i'm tired <laughter> i get tired throughout throughout the day you know but i kind of try to shake it off you know and just kind of like feel like it's a new day you know and just try to make the day that i have as great as possible you know and then try to like make it up by sleeping at night the day of <laughter> you know so yeah yeah yeah it's just you know it's okay i try to make it the best i guess if not then i just go to sleep throughout the day which sucks but yeah uh no <laughter> no uh been feeling good yeah i've been feeling really good um you know a lot of things in my life have you know it i'm having a really good year so far so i'm very happy with that you know everything's you know going good you know yeah it is it is except that i i just got out of a cold and it was horrible but that's just nature <laughter> my immune system has to work harder <laughter> yeah um super happy was uh when the doctor told me i was pregnant you know i was really really happy about that and i was just like ah you know <laughter> that was really really good you know very excited and just reading about what's going on with my body and what's going on with the baby and oh that's very overwhelming and it's scary at the same time <laughter> i've never really like uh you know but yeah i've yeah very happy uh um i don't know um i guess just me myself i uh you know like you know i could you know just be myself and that's it you know just i can't really you know say i have specific thing i guess i mean it depends on the person that meets me to tell me i can't really tell myself like oh i'm this i'm that just you know just try to be my best and try to portray something good for other people to tell me or you know compliment me or what not yeah um <laughter> nothing i think <laughter> um like i said i'm i'm happy with the person i am right now and you know my flaws or whatever you know i might have whatever flaw people see in me and it'ts okay you know i'm okay with it whatever it just i'm not gonna i'm i can't change myself for the likings of other people <laughter> i have only one body and one life so yeah yeah that's it uh just my childhood with my sisters and my family but you know it's you know i you learn from that you learn from the past and you kind of feel like hey you know maybe i should be a better role model you know for my children and so my children could be better role models so the world could just improve um just smile and be happy you know and whatever hard things happen you know you're gonna get through them eventually you know the only thing you can't um i don't know you can't you know go back on is death you know you could you know the heartbreak or it's whatever but you know as long as i'm alive i'm just i still gotta keep going yeah <laughter> um i don't know um that's pretty huh most proud of i guess that i'm trying my best to be the best i could be and that's pretty powerful you know i i'm you know i try to be you know a better person each day and try to like you know improve myself every day as much as i can you know that would probably be something i could be super proud of you know as much as i can very hard <laughter> i'm not gonna lie um it is really hard you know 'cause i can't say you know it's easy to be bad but it's hard to be good you know and you know it's it's always challenges and everything that goes you know in your life but you know it's just it's it's sometimes you know hard you know and sometimes it comes easy you know after a while you get a lot of practice and everything's just like you have a great day and you didn't even try <laughter> you know so yeah um you know loving friendly um outgoing you know adventurous i guess i don't know i guess that's what they say <laughter> i i just you know that's them like you know but that's what at least what i try to be you know at least i try to give a the best foot forward always as much as possible you know even sometimes even if i'm having a rough day i'm just like uh you know you know i just i don't wanna take it out on anyone or anything you know yeah um <laughter> my ideal weekend usually i i like going to the park i like sitting down in like a tree under a tree actually under a tree where there's shade and just kind of like put my blanket out there have my dog and like read a book and you know sometimes if i don't have my dog like there's little squirrels running around and they like me to feed them so that's pretty neat you know just sitting there and just enjoying the air and the noise <n> noise i guess 'cause there's not silence you know the wind and the cars and you know it's just it's really neat yeah awesome thank you you're welcome <laughter> bye 
<synch> yeah i'm doing pretty okay thanks for asking how are you uh i'm from here in l_a i grew up in the san fernando valley yeah uh <sigh> well i i like the the diversity of people the different kinds of food you can eat i like um the outdoor opportunities i grew up close to the hills so i i did a lot of hiking um camping is pretty close by i've gone snowboarding um i like eh the familiarity i think and you know it's it's a big city and uh you know i'm pretty familiar with it having lived here for so long that that i i i would say i like that too <laughter> probably the number one thing that everybody says i don't like traffic i don't like being stuck in traffic i don't like <deep breath> uh the long commutes even you know for short distances um and then you know it gets really hot in the summer at times so you know that eh i could stand it being a little <lit> slightly cooler when it gets to its peak peak heat but that's fine wow my dream job uh <sigh> that's a great question i <laughter> i think my dream job would probably be uh you know maybe being able to travel and somehow make money off of it profit off it you know make gainful employment off of traveling but that's almost an unrealistic dream since i don't know if i would actually wanna do that but if if i had to pick some kind of dream existence you know traveling getting paid to travel meeting new people trying new things and being able to make a living out of that would be pretty fun well i like like i mentioned what i like about l_a i like trying different kinds of food different cuisines so i think trying authentic cuisines in different places and meeting different kinds of people seeing different ways of life uh would be eh is what i like about traveling um i i like experiencing new things um i think that would be nice you know despite the fact that i said i like the familiarity of l_a there's also fun in discovering new things so i i think travel <tr> when i travel that's that's what i like to do just check new things out um so i would like to be you know <laughter> if i could make a living doing that that would be great uh one of my trips okay well let's see the the last trip i i took um lemmi think of one <on> one one more exciting trip um well my my family is from eastern europe so one of the trips i took with my parents when i was fourteen was i i went to um austria hungary and romania and uh you know getting to see some of those old castles <ca> i'd been a few times before but i it was when i was little so i don't really have too much memory plus i didn't really process things quite the same as when i was kinda more of age so i got to see you know my family's old uh you know hometown you know uh we have a family um like tomb so i got to see that then just these old buildings and just the different way of life i i i really liked that uh you know seeing my parents old friends um you know and so that was pretty fun it was very different it was like really my first time being taken away from my my home environment you know i i left in the middle of the school year um so it was just like going from you know suburban america to traveling around kind of uh you know taking these old trains and seeing these castles and these old like hundreds of year old towns and it i i don't know if um it was for everyone you know i don't know <laughter> if it would be great for everybody but i i really enjoyed it uh that's that's a good question i do <sigh> uh i probably one of the things i do is either turn on like a rerun of a sitcom um i used to i i watch the office a lot so i kinda know when that's on so i'll i'll turn that on you know just uh kind of zone out a little bit to uh you know like familiar characters and and hearing jokes that are still funny for some reason or um maybe like uh eating some kinda comfort food you know i try not to eat too much fast food at all but uh like in n' out i really like going there so if i have to unwind um you know it's once every few months maybe i'll do that uh or i really like to read um especially like uh i'll read the day's events you know that that really relaxes me for some reason even if it's reading about something some conflict going on somewhere in the world i i still i'll read the headlines and i really like to know what's going on that kind of centers me um so i i really enjoy that that's something i do to relax i would say <sigh> i'm pretty great at it although i don't i think my nature makes it pretty uh easy <eas> makes that pretty easy i don't <laughter> i don't get very upset <up> upset um easily at all so i it's not much of a challenge to control my temper eh um yeah i don't <do> i don't really have anger issues i it's it's difficult for me to get angry uh so i don't i don't <laughter> i don't really have much trouble with that at all the last time i argued with somebody was probably <sigh> i don't even know i i i mean small disagreements you know i might've had uh with family or friends about things but just a full on argument i i i i can't even remember it's been years i i don't really argue too much i try to avoid conflict as much as possible in my my personal life i don't um really see anything to be gained by and i kind of uh naturally repel away from it so i don't sorry i don't <do> <laughter> i don't have much to say about arguing something i feel guilty about i would say that uh you know sometimes <somet> i eh <sigh> sometimes i don't really um i feel like i maybe haven't made the most of my potential yet in life i i think that i could definitely do more despite the fact that i work a lot um i i feel like i there's always more opportunities uh out there that that we're missing i feel like you know sometimes down time i feel a little bit guilty about that because there's always something that i could be doing that i'm not even if it's just putting away the laundry that that's been um i took out of the dryer that's been sitting there or running late i really don't like running late um although <sigh> it happens more than i'd like to i'd and i don't know why i feel guilty about that i don't like keeping people wait waiting because it makes it feel like uh you know my time is somehow more valuable than theirs which is obviously not true um <sigh> hmm um nothing immediately comes to mind i well <sigh> the last car accident i got into i it was a few years ago i guess i i wish it hadn't have happened not that i wish i i've could erase it from my memory but i eh was um driving in rush hour traffic and you know i i thought the cars in front of me were were going um you know at least for a little you know ten fifteen feet but it turns out they had they had stopped so it was a <deep breath> you know xxx slow rear-end collision but it was still very unfortunate i was just uh you know it felt like i was paying attention one second and the next second you know i was just like reaching for something on the in the passenger seat and then i i smacked into the car in front of me and <deep breath> uh i i wish that hadn't've happened absolutely uh i know <kn> i know it's a minor thing but it was just really unfortunate the timing of it was very bad you know for me financially and the the people i got into an accident with were fine but i was <wa> you know they they you know didn't ask for anything beyond repairing the damages but uh it was just uh horrible timing um <deep breath> so i i wish that hadn't've happened it does suck <laughter> it did suck i'm over it now but eh yeah it it does suck well i'm a pretty good sleeper i although i i'm naturally wired to be up later at night so unfortunately my unfortunately my job um allows me affords me a pretty flexible schedule but at on the same token uh i wish i could <cou> were like hard-wired to go to sleep earlier because i just i wind up staying up 'til one or two every night uh and it's just too late you know even though i could get a full eight hours or whatnot of sleep it's not always at night time you know half my sleep is like in the kinda early daylight hours and i i wish i were more um able to sleep you know go to sleep at like ten or eleven and then sleep uh and then wake up earlier as opposed to going to sleep later and waking up later i've been pretty feeling pretty good i i've been i have no complaints physically and you know health-wise i feel good um you know my relationships with my my family and friends are good uh um everything is great so far i i have absolutely no no real complaints uh as far as how i'm feeling about myself or anything like that no no i've been fairly consistent with my behavior and my thoughts i think that um everything has been been pretty okay pretty steady no no nothing traumatic nothing um kinda resurfacing from the past nothing of the sort has has happened or is happening no no well i think there's plenty of things everybody regrets uh yeah yeah there's there's plenty of things um <sigh> in my life uh yeah like i said i i do regret uh you know maybe not trying harder in my younger days you know i there's a period of time in my early twenties where i i didn't work for a while i just uh i hung out with a lot of friend you know i guess it was like the proverbial bad crowd you know none of us worked we just uh you know we we got high every day um or it seemed like every day i don't know it was just uh eh but it was a it was kinda like a throw-away period in my life i would say that um <sigh> it's important to to to engage with the world i think i i think i kinda dropped out from the world a little bit i think it's also i would say that it's important to um recognize the people around you for what they are you know and what <wha> what kinda potential you know future activities they you can expect from from the people you surround yourself with i think that uh i would say also that um kinda try to focus on what i wanted to do with my life as opposed to just thinking well you know things will work out which eventually they do but i i think that you know there's a bit of lost time with that um that approach it's kinda fatalistic and i i think that i would say you know um just try to concentrate you know you know not <no> not everyone works on the same schedule and life isn't a race but i would say that it was it's important to have a goal in mind or some kind of you know idea for what what you want out of life as opposed to just kinda waiting and um thinking that things will fall into place um <sigh> well i <sigh> i i guess when people i i don't especially um take even constructive criticism particularly well for some reason i i think that for <f> at least for myself i sort of have things figured out although i i i'm sure i'm wrong about that so i think just maybe in terms of like uh group work that i've done professionally or or academically you know when when some of my work is uh kinda picked apart or or scrutinized i don't <d> i don't deal well with that and i i take it more personally than i should uh it was probably about a year and a half ago i was working on a research project at work and uh somebody with much less experience <exp> it was three of us working on something and then they brought it another pair of eyes just to go over it and it was somebody just out of uh college you know um went over what we had done and you know it was just kinda rewording things and it it seemed just like cosmetic changes that were being made just for the sake of of changing things and i kinda took personal offense to that just uh because i thought i had a lot more experience and more education and uh it it was unnecessary you know i i thought that the whole thing was a waste of time and you know i just um i i didn't think that she was somebody that was qualified to to necessarily redo all our work um or or even to uh not not to redo it but to to edit it or to uh <sigh> not <no> eh proofread i guess to to make any kind of you know qualitative changes i i just thought that it was a a really bad idea and and i i thought that i you know i i shouldn't have viewed it this way but i thought that the fact that they brought in somebody with almost no experience you know was kind of like a an affront to us who had worked on it on this project but you know it wasn't our call <sigh> mm most memorable experiences um well i guess the <sigh> first thing that comes to mind is one of my um the first real trip i took by myself uh i i took the uh the amtrak to to new mexico and i was out there exploring things um for about ten days on my own uh so that was kind of the longest period of time up 'til that point and i was in my i was i don't know twenty three maybe at the time that i i'd really just been on my own completely cut off from everyone i was in parts of new mexico where there was no cell phone reception at the time um and it was very memorable because i was on it on my own i felt like i was really uh you know exposed to the things i wouldn't have seen if i had had traveling companions um and it was a lot of fun uh well i've been very happy recently i for the i i'm getting married in a few months uh i got engaged on labor day uh in two thousand twelve thanks <laughter> so i i was uh that was a very happy day this this whole process you know of um of meeting someone and we we kinda progressed very quickly realized where we recognized where we were um so i i've been a pretty happy state the past uh well it's been eleven months now but um yeah so i i think that the day we got engaged and then we we shared it with our family i think those have been very happy times um new years was happy you know uh i i'm in a happy period of my life right now so yeah yeah thank you <laughter> uh <sigh> with a <sigh> sort of um sense of humor that maybe not everybody gets i'd say uh also uh you know um helpful calm relaxed maybe uh <sigh> intelligent um you know likes to recycle i know that's so something that they would say uh i what else i think that um my best friend might say that uh i i i like animals i've always had dogs and cats so they might describe me as a people person or i mean a an animal person excuse me i also um you know fairly easygoing you know flexible with with plans mm uh i'd say one of <sigh> most proud of in my life um hmm <tisk> well <sigh> i i i'm pretty happy with the level of education i've gotten i'm also going back eh starting in the fall i'm starting a p_h_d program so i'm happy about that i'm happy about you know breaking some of my bad habits from the past i i'd say if i'm proud of anything it's that um you know i have a strong faith relationship i go to church often i'm i'm very happy about that i don't know if pride is the right word but um my relationships with my family and friends are all very good uh i'd say maybe the fact that it's a lot different than my life is a lot different than it was about ten years ago you know the the change i'm i'm happy and proud of that no problem have a good day thank you goodbye 
<synch> yes i'm doing pretty good thank you i was born in the san fernando valley in california really <laughter> uh i love the beaches i like uh there's just many things to do and uh you can't beat the weather uh traffic cost of living uh no i haven't uh i've only been out of the country once or a few times actually but only to one other country mm well they were when i was younger before i turned twenty one and we used to uh go to tijuana across the border just to get into nightclubs and stuff like that uh well i love to see new things new places uh and uh have new experiences uh after high school i went to beauty school for cosmetology mm well at the time i was uh looking for a career change and uh i have some friends in the industry and uh i decided to take the classes and see see what i thought uh only as a hobby mm well uh that's a that's a tough one to answer i'd have to think about that i would be on the outgoing side uh just because i'm more outgoing than i am shy <laughter> uh lotta times i smoke marijuana mm not the best uh i had an argument with my mother over uh how we should handle doing things with my grandmother well we just had differences on uh who should do what at what times and who's in control and uh i should pretty much let her uh follow her rules because it's you know she's her daughter well it's okay i understood we talked it out and you know realized that uh i might've been uh overstepping my bounds uh it's fairly good i am pretty close with my mom and uh my grandmother i have a stepfather and a half-brother we get along okay but we're not very close and i've never met my real father um maybe not accomplishing as much as i should have in my life up to now uh yeah maybe by not having enough uh ambition or drive to be in a better position in my life uh well one of the hardest decisions was when i moved moved uh away from los angeles to wisconsin well when i was younger i was getting in trouble and i was looking for a way out so i went and continued getting into trouble and i <deep breath> with a friend <sigh> uh we just packed our bags and moved to milwaukee yes uh extremely difficult i guess uh i got a lotta things going on or not going on and it just makes it hard for me to sleep um issues in my life and uh sure sometimes mm i guess it depends on what i have to do right now a little well in the last few minutes since we started talking about depressing stuff i starting to feel a little more down i haven't no mm very seldom <psh> stop thinking about 'em mm i don't know i couldn't tell i couldn't answer that right now um i guess i felt uh eh it's been awhile since i've been really happy i don't have uh a whole lot of very happy thoughts as recently mm <deep breath> oh let's see i <sigh> did go to las vegas uh a couple months ago i had a good time there well i'm a honest person for the most part reliable uh i think i'm easy to get along with wow where do i start i have plenty of uh bad decisions i could erase um yeah well i have a d_u_i on my record uh well for the time it suspended my license makes it extremely difficult <diff> makes life extremely difficult well yeah it's uh hard to get around when you can't drive legally and if you do drive illegally you're at risk of going to jail for driving without a license uh well the original charge did but i haven't got caught driving since mm i don't have a best friend mm well let's come back to that one mm maybe that i could uh follow through with some of my plans be a little more ambitious maybe not uh well <we> some of the decisions i've made in my life i have regrets <sigh> uh take care of business first and always handle your responsibilities good <go> uh good weather good music good company good conversation mm <sigh> wow i don't have an answer for ya i love to uh bike ride i can go for walks or hikes uh i love to swim in the ocean mm my mom well she uh she was a single mom with two kids and uh worked really hard to raise us yeah yeah it wasn't easy very sure bye <laughter> 
<synch> yes um pretty good kind of <laughter> yeah <laughter> about los angeles yes the thing i like about l_a the weather it's not easy to meet people well it just feels like people aren't out very much they're like that movie in crash where people are just sit in their cars all the time um it feels like that no not too much child development well i have a son and i wanted to know how to be a a good mom and so i wanted to know about the stages uh that he would be going through eh and be able to relate better to him mhm i am kind of i'm trying to get it started again in the fall i'd like to write well um i've written some children's books and i've just been doing research looking into getting my books published it's only like two that i've written so far but they're pretty good i've gotten some good feedback on them from my critique groups <laughter> it's about a little boy that's surrounded by people that are jerks and he tries to not become a jerk with them and <laughter> it puts him in like a really scrubbed_entry he goes through a lot of moods dealing with the people in his life mhm um no i've had some issues some nervous breakdowns actually and right now my son is staying with his dad so <laughter> um no i'm a single mom it was the hardest thing i think in the world <laughter> is being a single mom <laughter> so how do i cope <deep breath> um <sigh> well right now um i didn't have very many good <goo> coping skills or mechanisms so that was the problem it's so spontaneous like the stuff that comes outta kids' mouths sometimes and the stuff that they do and just brings a smile to your face um well when my son was younger once we were just sitting around the house and he comes and he starts doing my hair and he says to me mom i want you to put on some lipstick and high heels and ponytails so you can go out and get married and find a boyfriend <laughter> so yeah it's pretty spontaneous things like that happen that my kid's telling me i need to not be single anymore <laughter> the hardest thing <sigh> not wanting to screw it up i feel a lot of stress and pressure that every little thing is gonna make <ma> make a difference and matter in what kind of person my kid turns out to be and so it's a lot of stress on yourself <laughter> yeah yeah <laughter> definitely um hmm i think i'm different from my mom because i'm a little bit more tolerant of that spontaneous interaction i welcome it you know i welcome getting to know who my child is right now and not try to mold them into somebody that i want them to be but just see them become the best child that they can be the best adult that they can be without molding them in that direction necessarily into a different person <laughter> so say it again who's someone that's a positive influence um <sigh> mm i don't really have anybody like that okay well i've tried to meditate sometimes but i don't really stick with it often enough um i've tried to like go for walks but i don't always do that and i don't always stick with it <laughter> so yeah that's about it <sigh> i'd say i'm a little below average meaning that i get angry more than most people do i think hmm last night <laughter> but it was on the telephone i was arguing with my husband um we have my sister lives with us and she lives with us in a very small room with a small apartment i should say and she's got four people living in in one room so um it's kind of stressful it's really crowded and my husband is stressed out about it and you know i'm just saying to him that i told you so i told you if my sister moved in here then there was gonna be a mess in the house and she's gonna be asking for things you don't really wanna do that's just how my sister is <laughter> so the house is messy and it's crowded and every day they're asking for rides and my husband he's avoiding coming home because all these people are home and he doesn't wanna be there anymore and i'm just saying that he's gonna have to find a way to deal with it because he asked for it in my opinion <laughter> so <laughter> hmm it does <laughter> oh i've got tons of 'em but right now what's on my mind is um losing custody of my son um right now like i've been arguing with my stepmom and my stepsister for a long time about my son and how they treat him and how i want him to be treated like they don't have any boundaries and i believe that boundaries are important establishing who's the adult who's the child they let my child boss 'em around and stuff anyways because of this they're gonna be testifying against me in the custody trial saying that yeah they're gonna be saying that i'm not a good mom because i believe in having boundaries and we have very different ideas about child raising she's my stepmom she's my dad's fifth wife and she's she really doesn't she's really far removed from how i was raised and i wanna raise my child more similar to how i was raised where you're we had some independence and we had some boundaries and we knew what the rules were and what was expected of us and with my stepmom she xxx no rules she has no expectation she just wants him to run wild and have everything that he wants and that's fine when you're a grandparent but the problem is that i live with them sometimes and when i'm in the same house with them they should be following my rules and not trying to go and break all of my rules <sigh> anyway <laughter> yeah um in that moment <sigh> just really frustrated because they don't listen to me i feel disrespected i feel like invisible i feel just angry that they're taking away my right to parent and it's something that i worked really hard to do i went to school and i studied child development i've read all the magazines and i've read the books and i'm really <laughter> i know what i'm talking about i feel confident in my parenting skills and my parenting abilities and to have these people that haven't done the same thing and worked as hard as i have to be a good parent try and tell me that i'm a bad parent it's really uh hard to believe so i feel very disrespected um unacknowledged angry frustrated all those things <laughter> um i take i take benadryl to help me sleep and i'm so <laughter> my doctor gave me that <laughter> uh she gave me benadryl told me that i could take it to help me sleep and last night i was crying before i went to sleep so sometimes these thoughts start running through your head at night when you're in bed but i tried to push them out and then i got up and i took my benadryl so i could go to sleep more easily <laughter> yeah i'm always thinking about my son how i wish he was with me and how unfair everything is that's happening <sniffle> and like i don't deserve to have my son taken from me because i'm a really good mom you know <sobbing> and i'm too hard on myself so but i am a good mom and i feel confident that i'm a good mom i just i don't really have the money to take care of my son like my dad the son's dad does he has more money than me and right now i'm trying to be okay with it because i know he can do more for him financially than i could but that doesn't mean i'm not a good mom <laughter> hmm i'm pretty depressed i'm on anti-depressants um i take wellbutrin i been on them for a couple weeks now i think they're working i don't know i'm not as down as i was i mean i got here today i got dressed <laughter> i made it out and i'm here today so not that bad um <sigh> hmm my husband complains a lot he says i'm not the same person that i was when he married me he said i was fun and i was positive and i was all these other optimistic things that's another thing he was on the phone telling me last night and <sniffle> and i'm not those things anymore <laughter> which is true i mean we got married a year ago and then my son was taken shortly after and it was just such a shock and um i've just been trying to get back from it but it's been hard did i think i had a problem before i found out found out what oh um yeah like crying a lot something like i cry all the time <sobbing and laughing> it doesn't take much for me to cry i'm just crying thinking about crying but like um my family would invite me to family events and i would go and just just cry because my son wasn't there <sniffle> or um i don't know it's just all the crying i think and like i said my husband letting me know that i'm not the same person so he's disappointed and i feel bad even that <crying and laughing> i'm not the same person that he he knew <crying and laughing> i feel bad about that too another thing i'm feeling bad about you know <crying> yes i do i try do i feel like the therapy's useful um yeah it's nice to talk about your problems i go in there and i cry every week so at least i have a set time every week where i can go in and cry <laughter> um that's i mean it's a release to be able to cry sometimes i feel better afterwards um yeah and she helps me make decisions you know help me to be more proactive in my life um well i'm looking for jobs and things like that and she gives me ideas of why don't you work here or why don't you work there or have you thought about this or that you know and then she said something about why don't you go back to school and so i went and applied to go back to school you know i'm not doing much with my life and sitting around all day isn't helping my depression any either so i'm trying to find a work and i applied for college in the fall i got accepted to dominguez hills so i may be going back to school in the fall right now i'm still looking for work but she helps me with that kinda stuff just giving me ideas that life isn't over <laughter> that there's still more you know i could be doing with life life yeah everything's always bittersweet um i don't know last time i was really happy i don't know <laughter> my ideal weekend oh i don't have a lot of money 'cause i'm not working right now so really my weekends are just spent reading maybe but i can't really i i can't pay much attention when i'm reading so <laughter> i have a short attention span i can only read a couple chapters <deep breath> um but lately i say that's what i've been doing is reading something i've read xxx okay i like to go to u_s_c they have these nights where they have things like book signings or poetry and art it's called visions and voices so i like to go out to <t> to their events and i usually enjoy those um about two weeks ago um deborah harkness was there doing a book signing for a discovery of witches and so like i said i'm trying to be a writer so i try to go especially to the book signings and see what it's like to be an author who's talking to a crowd and signing books <laughter> my son <laughter> i don't have any friends my best qualities um <sigh> i'm smart i'm good-looking um i'm really um and like a hard worker i i'm dedicated to like self-improvement um that's all i can think of right now <laughter> okay okay goodbye press the buzzer now 
<synch> yes pretty good alexandria virginia mhm uh i moved to l_a uh end of two thousand one yeah it's crazy <laughter> um a couple times a year usually like for holidays hmm <sigh> it is <sigh> it's very different um i think it's a lot more mellow um it's way more like suburbia it's nice um it there's something comforting about it but it's always like i get a little restless when i'm there and look forward to coming back here where there's a little more action <sniffle> i went to um grad school at u_s_c um it was it wasn't bad i mean my my program that i was in was so intense that like for the first year it was so all consuming that i really didn't have much spare time to think about the adjustment it was just like i <laughter> my life was not my own so that made it kind of um easier i guess and also i was like in a community of people that i went to school with so automatically i knew people and you know made friends and stuff so it wasn't bad film hmm <sigh> i uh had an epiphany one day um i was out of undergrad i was kinda floundering a little bit i didn't really know what i wanted to do and um just one day i kinda was like you know what am i really excited about what am i really passionate about and um i realized that movies <m> movies are the thing that i love the most and am most passionate about so that is how i decided to go to film school um a little bit yes and no it's i don't i'm so <s> i'm like in a little bit of a transitional period right now but yeah like for the last several years i've been uh producing like freelance producer <sniffle> <sigh> that is so the question of the moment <laughter> um i think that uh i don't necessarily have like a a job title that's my dream job but i knowit's sort of what um i want and 'cause basically like i've been living a freelance lifestyle for a while and i know that that is like exhausting and i don't wanna do that anymore so i'm looking for something that's stable um you know full time nice benefits and um i definitely wanna stay in the entertainment industry um and i like you know what i love about producing is that it's just like there's constant challenges and you sort of never know what is gonna get thrown at you that i that's you know it's always interesting and exciting um so i'm sort of trying to figure out right now what would be a good place for me to be where i can be reasonably challenged and you know have sort of a like room to to grow and advance and all that <sniffle> yeah <laughter> i can't see your shoes um i i like to travel um i don't know that i haven't really been doing it a lot lately but i have you know in the past done a fair amount um i love the adventure of it just you know new experiences new places new people um i think it's just good to sort of get out of your little insular world and see what's out there and just you know see beautiful remarkable places and just and things and just experience different ways of living and different languages and different cultures <sniffle> um let's see i went to costa rica a couple years ago um my like best friend from growing up she and i went for like ten days  and it was that's probably that might be like my favorite trip of all time <laughter> like it was really awesome but <laughter> costa rica is just like amazing and beautiful um and we just spent like we went to three different places and um just did a lot of exploring and like sightseeing we did a ton of hiking which was amazing and then like the last place where we ended up was this little beach town so by that point it was like we felt like you know we had done all this like amazing physical exertion like doing ziplines and all these hikes so that by the time we got to the beach it was like we've earned the right to just like kick back and relax and you know so it was just it kind of it hit all of the you know it like fed that sort of desire for adventure and activity um but it also i'm also a big fan of vacations where you just like veg out and relax and like lie on a beach with a book so it sort of hit everything <sniffle> <laughter> what do i do to relax um <sigh> i i mean depending where i am like if it's you know if i'm like at work or something and i'm stressed out i just will you know kinda take a minute and just like breathe really deeply and try to just calm myself down that way um if i'm home i might just like you know throw on a movie or like a t_v show that i really like and just that gives a sense of like sort of escape relief <sniffle> um pretty good i don't i mean eh it takes a lot to get me very angry it doesn't happen very often <sniffle> um the last time i argued with someone was <laughter> my mom and it was about money <laughter> <deep breath> um i felt really frustrated because i felt like she was like judging me unfairly and that was upsetting yeah <laughter> um it's good uh you know they live across the country from me so i don't get to see them that often but like i usually talk to my mom on the phone probably like once a week and my parents are really supportive <sigh> um they are you know like when i go back home to visit like i enjoy <en> i enjoy hanging out with them we have a good time um so i'd say we have a pretty pretty good relationship <deep breath> something i feel guilty about um <sigh> <makes sounds with mouth> i guess because i'm like in this sort of job hunting phase i feel guilty sometimes that i'm not like doing enough you know like there are times where like there are days where maybe like i should've sent out a few more resumes or done more stuff like i i feel guilty sometimes for not being like productive enough <sniffle> <deep breath> um <sigh> usually it's pretty easy the last the last couple weeks like has been uncharacteristically like not as good i'm not really sure i haven't figured it out but um i've just had more uh like nights where it either takes me a really long time to go to sleep or i wake up in the middle of the night for no reason um i've also been having a lot of like really weird intense dreams that like i wake up sometimes i wake myself up sometimes <laughter> because i'm talking which is weird <laughter> um so yeah it's just i i don't know not that i have been able to identify i mean i guess maybe i'm like more stressed than usual just 'cause like i my job situation is like in flux but i i don't know there was no like event <sniffle> cranky <laughter> i value good sleep <laughter> and i'm so i'm used to it so it's just yeah it's not a good feeling <sniffle> um not really no yes <deep breath> um <sigh> like <sigh> i think in like october or november although this is actually it's the second time it's happened in my life but the first time was like many many years ago <sniffle> um i felt like i was a really low and like too low for me to get myself out of it <sniffle> um <sigh> just having a hard time functioning on the most basic level like just getting up and taking a shower and like going to the grocery store and you know answering emails was just like it took so much energy um so yeah i just i wasn't  really functioning normally  yeah yes yes um <laughter> sometimes more than others but yeah overall i would say so <deep breath> i think that therapy is good for me because it helps me focus on my sort of patterns um and also like ah just like observing how i am like responding to certain situations and just it i guess it's <deep breath> it gives me a more heightened like kind of self-awareness um so that as opposed to just like um kind of just reacting to situations i'm like mm just like noticing more what is going on um and it just helps to um i don't know it's just helpful <laughter> i don't really <real> i don't really know how to explain it <laughter> <deep breath> <sigh> hmm <sigh> um i don't know um i <laughter> it's <laughter> probably not good that i can't think of <laughter> i can't think of anything <sharp inhale> um eh maybe over uh over christmas being at home with my family yeah um well it just was that was like i was kind of like just starting to come out of my depression then and um like you know i live alone here i have i have a dog but so i just had a long period of feeling not <laughter> great and just sort of doing it all on my own and kinda wishing that my family was around me um so when i was there with them it just um it just felt very like safe and comfortable and that just sort of like you know warm familial embrace <laughter> <laughter> um <sigh> <laughter> i think she would describe me as funny and smart and um a good listener nonjudgmental um i don't know <laughter> is that enough <laughter> <deep breath> hmm <sigh> okay um so this happened the the last like job that i had i mean i was it wasn't technically i was a freelancer but i was working for this company for like a year and a half close to two years and uh i had a it very small company the boss <bo> had a really good relationship with my boss um and he sort of <clears throat> he sort of out of nowhere uh mm told me that he was like downsizing basically and um essentially like the arrangement that we had is that he paid me like a monthly retainer for my services and then on top of that i would get paid fees per project so he like sat me down on this conversation and was like you know our major client that is like you know the bread and butter of the company they're the they're really cutting back like you probably notice things are getting really slow and i was like yeah and he's like so i'm gonna <onna> i'm gonna <onna> have to stop paying you your retainer and this was a total surprise but i was just like okay and he went on to talk about how he i would still have the right of first refusal of all the projects that came through the door and you know because of that he made it seem like you know even though i wouldn't be getting the retainer anymore he would throw enough work at me still that like i wouldn't you know it wouldn't be like a dramatic decrease in the amount of money that i was making <cough> excuse me but um and he was like you know this has nothing to do with the quality of your work i love working with you you're fantastic yada yada so to make a long story short what ended up happening is he was firing me um and he that was his way of basically like phasing me out of the company and letting me go because from that point he stopped calling me he stopped emailing me and later on like a couple of months down the road i um i had to go back into the office because there were a couple projects that were still ongoing like the client took a really long time to get back with their notes and when i was in there i saw that um this guy who had worked with us a bunch kind of like if we needed another producer like if we were slammed we would bring him on to do sort of additional stuff he was doing my job so yeah so it just like it was a really <rea> <laughter> it was a really shitty way to be like fired without being told that i was fired um and it was just like that uh the reason i would like i if i could i would erase that from my mind is because i can't really think of another situation that made me feel so like angry and frustrated and just like in a way that's like that still even though this was like you know several months ago feels very unresolved and still makes me kinda like angry when i think about it so yeah that was a very long explanation but that's what i wish <laughter> <deep breath> um <sigh> let's see i um a very loyal person <deep breath> um i am smart i'm organized i <deep breath> um very like caring kind um i'm conscientious and i work hard <sniffle> <laughter> uh man i think to uh be more confident and less passive um to really like focus on what i want and the things that i know will make me happy and to just go out and get them as opposed to sitting back and waiting for opportunities to present themselves <sniffle> hmm <sigh> um probably just some of the relationships that i formed with people um just like really you know deep friendships you're welcome bye 
<synch> yes good it's been a nice day the south bay can i ask you that question too oh okay that's where i'm from basically but like the south bay of it not much i've been wanting to move anyways just to get a change-up everybody thinks l_a is like everything it's the best but it's too many people and too much traffic <clears throat> i can't see your shoes <sniffle> driving and seeing new stuff last year i went to sacramento from here and stayed out for like a month living in my v_w bus with my wife it was kinda cool camping just wanted to have fun something different art no a little bit probably doing what you're doing <laughter> i'm really interested in coming up with new ideas and stuff too <clears throat> outgoing <laughter> i haven't been doing much to do relax relaxing lately but i like the beach good i argued with my brother last night actually about him talking to me with with more respect as a person i was mad and i wanted to fight it's good but sometimes they're just they're too caught up in what they're doing to pay attention to other people's feelings like with my brother he's just he's just tense because of his situation and he tried to brush <br> brush it off on me wasting money 'cause i'm married now yeah not doing it something like probably taking some candy from the store no no taking money from my mom when i was like real young 'cause she well i was like i was in junior high school and i think i took like twenty from her purse and bought candy for my friends and i felt guilty though like the same day probably yeah that was probably the beginning of my stupid activities all my life or in the past couple years my wife i'm married to her we've known each other for about two years i met her at an art walk she actually went to u_s_c too the past couple days has been kinda hard but i usually go to sleep good i think i'm kinda snappy <sn> i think i'm snappy positive optimistic yeah i've been thinking more positive positively lately and i wanna put a lot of stuff into action so i've been trying to train my mind into knowing that stuff is gonna come to me speaking to the universe easy if you just try it and do it everybody's got a spirit no no no i just told you i feel positive i was happy yesterday <yester> i happy yesterday 'cause i you know i made a couple good decisions wanting to be positive and stay away from negative people being alive knowing god i don't know i don't know i can't think of something now <laughter> mm i don't think i can have one sex exercising waking up positive and having a good meal in the morning i think driving to sacramento that time no don't smoke cigarettes and watch how you spend your money are you gonna sell my ideas and my my uh <laughter> thoughts i can't think of it right now 
<synch> yes i'm doing okay it's still morning so i'm from the east coast massachusetts yes um i moved to l_a when i was a child with my parents pretty much didn't have any choice in the matter <laughter> um i haven't been back there the last time i was back there was uh three years ago for christmas um l_a's very hustle and bustle there's a lot of people that are angry and a lot of people don't care about the other person here in l_a in which back east the east coast the the thought pattern is a lot different you know your neighbors you're friendly to your neighbors and to anybody that you see in the street so the yeah um well since i was a kid i was fairly young at first it was rough i was getting in trouble a little bit in school but uh after all that surpassed i was <wa> i did fine in high shcool and stuff and even took some college courses um well i love the beach and i love the mountains i like to go hiking um and i like walking along the beach i just live a few blocks away from the beach so it's easy no not at all um just not interested uh i've been to mexico a couple times when i was younger went to ensenada but other than that i'm i'm not interested in leaving the united states especially with what's been going on lately um overseas um <laughter> actually child psychology and i was in the nursing program for a little bit but i had some problems at home which caused me to drop out <sniffle> oh that's alright gah um i don't have one to be honest um i admire people that are doing the job that they love i mean like football players they love playing football and they get paid all that money how great is that <laughter> so um i'm pretty outgoing when i meet somebody at first i might be a little bit reserved because we all when we meet somebody pass judgment um as to if we wanna continue communicating with the person or not and but once i've decided that i like that person or whatever i i talk a lot so yes um i like watching movies i like i used to like reading but lately my concentration level hasn't been so great so it's hard to get into a good book um not good at times i uh i have a some outburst every once in awhile so <s> eh it depends on how angry i get uh yesterday and it was with my partner and um actually to be honest i don't remember what it was about it's just sometimes people can have an ugly attitude and i don't appreciate that and if i feel that i'm being disrespected or whichever i'm gonna stand up for myself so um at times some people may be turned off for my personality because very opinionated and i say what i'm what's on my mind um i do not purposely go and hurt people's feelings or anything of that nature but i won't be bullied and i won't be made i won't back down if i feel like i'm being challenged so um uh last year my mother died so i wish i handled that differently um it upsets <ups> it's upsets me so it's okay um let me see <deep breath> uh <sigh> i think i'm gonna pass on that one too because that'll upset me more so <laughter> <sniffle> that is terrible um sometime uh sometimes actually falling asleep may not be a problem especially you know when you're done working and doing everything that you had to do in a day you're tired but staying asleep is a whole different thing for me because it's like i can't uh i get up and then i'm i'm wide awake i'll go out in the living room turn on the t_v and watch t_v i'm lucky if i get three to four hours sleep um maybe because i do have a lot on my mind uh you know thinking about bills and and the stressfulness of work and and then all this other stuff so that's probably a big burst part of it uh it's it's not difficult it's just frustrating 'cause when your mind goes on overtime mode it eh just affects everything your concentration your sleep your eating everything so i'm a little grouchy especially in the morning i'm not a morning person <laughter> i like the nights but i don't like the morning it's like leave me alone until i get my first cup of coffee yeah so other than that i'm i'm okay um well i've been i've been depressed for quite some time and i'm still having difficulty <diff> difficulty uh 'cause after my mother died four months later my uncle died so i had two deaths last year so i'm still reeling and trying to get myself back together i'm i just recently i've started pursuing like interests that i used to do that i haven't done in a year because of what happened um i just i might get angry a little easier i sleep a lot i eat i overeat um i get tired very easily 'cause i'm not getting much sleep so sometimes it's hard it seems like i'm struggling to get through the day yes i have a uh psychiatrist that prescribes me medication on a regular basis oh i was diagnosed quite some time ago um probably ten to fifteen years ago and it's just something i've never gotten over i don't know whether or not you can so i've always taken the medicine um i was arguing with everybody my family my friends and stuff like that and i was feeling desperate and hopeless and i had attempted to uh take my own life years ago which caused me to be hospitalized and then uh they started treating me i started seeing a therapist so um well right now i'm not going to a therapist because my insurance they'll cover the psychiatrist and not the therapist but i am working with a friend of mine who has <ha> knows some avenues to go to seek <se> seek help for a therapist and i don't know if that's really gonna help me i mean sometime <someti> it depends on what kinda therapist you get sometimes people just sit there and they just listen to you talk and ramble on and you're thinking my god what good is this and the other type is the type that will give you some kinda feedback as to how to deal with the emotions tools to help you deal with your emotions so um like i said i haven't been going to therapy recently just psychiatrist just medication um there's been no changes really i i probably would be doing fine because i was doing great before my mom passed away i was her caregiver and uh even though a lot of times i feeled i felt overwhelmed or lacked <l> uh lacked patience with her uh i still was a heck of a lot happier than i am now so um uh <sigh> i would say when my son was born years ago i'm not a parent anymore he passed away so um and that was difficult as well uh hmm um i'm extremely organized extremely reliable my work loves me because i get everything done that i'm supposed to get done even though sometimes i feel a little scatterbrained and um you know those qualities are are admirable in people that can keep their word and and be responsible excuse me oh i have lots of regrets um uh things that i've done in the past that i'm not too happy about but um you know i met somebody once in my life that had had that saying and you see it on a bumper sticker uh live to never regret so you know you can't go back and make changes it's too late so why you know dwell on the situation but sometimes <so> sometimes it's a lot easier said than done um i'm not the advice kinda get person <laughter> i i you know i don't really give my friends any kind of advice i mean i find most of the times people don't listen to you anyway so why bother um i just state my opinion that's all um well right now i'm on a diet because of my overeating after my mom died i was a lot thinner when she was alive i just went crazy with the food and sleeping a lot you know sleep eat sleep eat and so now i'm kinda like on a diet trying to lose this weight 'cause it's very unhealthy for me um hmm trying to think it's been a long time actually there's really nothing because now i just keep my mind busy i haven't been to a movie in ages i don't i used to go out shopping all the time i don't now um so it's been it uh it's been quite some time since i've been content and happy with who i am and what i'm doing in my life right now um my weekends saturday <sa> uh like on saturday i'm usually working um on sunday is usually clean up day you know do your laundry clean up the house um run some errands go shopping for food you know that kinda thing so it's not if i was younger you know it would be fun you know go out clubbing or whatever but i'm too old for that now xxx um hmm really there's nothing that i can think of um there's nothing that i can be proud of hmm um some a good like comedy or whatever i like to watch that um sometimes my partner might do something stupid which i like because i like make fun of him um but mm just that's it you know go <g> maybe go out for a walk on the beach that's it okay no problem thank you bye 
<synch> <sniffle> <sniffle> yes i'm feeling okay little bit tired but for the most part feeling pretty good i'm actually originally from woodland hills which is out in the san fernando valley i was born there and then i moved to lomita which is in los angeles county about mm probably around nineteen ninety three so i mean i'm twenty three now so it's about what yeah nineteen years or so i've been living there yeah <clears throat> some things that that i really like i would have to say you know the beach um you know not so much the traffic don't really care for that but um definitely you know just kinda like the nightlife um you know just people in general i like conversing with others so yeah <clears throat> right yep yeah actually i do i mean i can't see your shoes but um yeah actually i do travel a lot i've been to places like hawaii been to the caribbean i've been to uh let's see <makes sound with mouth> um you know just different places like arizona i've been to oregon washington pretty much all over i would say so but usually mainly like um hawaii and the caribbean mexico as well so yep <clears throat> um i think it's just the experience you know like you can't you can kinda experience the culture um different people you know just just the whole background the scenery it's just you know it's it's something new to experience i would say something that you know people haven't seen before so <clears throat> well let's see i recently took a trip to hawaii a couple months ago that was back in december it was around christmas time new years so that was pretty fun we went to a couple different islands we went to uh let's see i think it was kauai went to oahu uh maui you know places like that so <clears throat> yep um you know i would have to say that um you know probably like in hawaii or like the caribbean you know just like i said before the whole experience factor just seeing um you know new different things things that are unique so <clears throat> yeah i actually study journalism right now i'm in my final semester so i'm about <bout> to graduate couple months <clears throat> yep well you know it's kinda funny 'cause you know i started off at a uh you know a two year community college and so you know i was going into uh like business management something to do with you know i think <thin> basically um accounting but you know i kinda figured that wasn't for me so i decided to go into journalism 'cause i i couldn't i mean you know i'd probably still be sitting at a desk but you know at least with journalism i can go out in the field and you know talk to people and you know kinda you know receive information gather information that sorta deal and then you know write up stories i just thought it was you know it was a lot more interesting for me as opposed to you know just kinda crunching numbers all day so yep <laughter> my dream job i would have to say um you know some something in maybe radio broadcasting sports broadcasting um you know i think that would be really interesting something that's definitely a passion of mine so <clears throat> my relationship with my family it's it's pretty good you know i i live with my parents still like i said i'm twenty three years old um you know there's certain times when it can be a little bit shaky little bit rocky but for the most part it's it's pretty good you know i've i've matured a lot in the last few years so things are uh you know getting back up to speed i would say things are things are going pretty well <clears throat> you know i think it stems somewhere kind of in the middle you know sometimes i can be very outgoing and talkative to people when i'm relaxed and laid-back other times i kinda it's not so much like i go into my shell but you know at times like i can be kinda shy if i don't know people as well or if i haven't i've never met them before so it's one of those things that kinda <ki> yeah you kinda gotta meet me in the middle with it because you know i can either be talk very talkative or at times you know i i can be a little bit shy but you know once i once i get the conversation going i'm i'm fairly talkative and so <clears throat> <laughter> um you know usually um i would listen to music or you know maybe just you know kinda go for a drive or uh you know hang out with my friends you know just something to just to kinda you know ease ease that you know 'cause you know like i said sometimes you get a little bit you know tense and you just wanna relax and you know just do the things that you enjoy so <clears throat> you know i've actually been better with that um couple years back you know i there was points where like i pretty much couldn't control my temper like whatsoever like <li> i mean i would just pretty much get angry at you know the littlest things everything would just kinda tick me off but you know i've i've definitely learned to uh you know control that sorta thing and you know it's made me a better person because of it <clears throat> well let's see i'm trying to think it's it was probably something with my family with my mother maybe it's i i can't remember off the top of my head but you know it's it's always something so miniscule that that's why i probably don't remember it but you know eventually we make up and i apologize for it because you know i accept that you know i'm wrong in certain <cer> you know certain circumstances <clears throat> yeah something that i feel guilty about um probably you know not being as nice to others as i could've been in the past you know i mean and that is the past and you know i don't like to dwell on that sorta thing but i think that's one thing that i that i've tried to work on but it's also one thing that i kinda regret not doing just being just being nice <clears throat> hardest decision i ever had to make uh it was pretty recent kinda tough because uh i actually have a buddy he was in the air force and he recently got diagnosed with uh paranoid schizophrenia so that was really tough and it's hard for me to talk to him because you know he's he's not really all there anymore like he used to be so it's one of those things where i feel like i'm kind of ignoring him and i don't wanna do that but at the same time i don't know his tendencies he could be a little you know crazy so probably like you know some sort of like traumatic stress disorder maybe when he was in the military so i don't know but yeah <clears throat> yeah it's pretty tough you know 'cause we go way back been best friends with him <sigh> since i was probably about five six years old so it's just yeah it's just really hard to deal with but you know i i try to i don't i don't  you know try to keep in the back of my mind but you know it's it's always there i don't i don't ever forget so yeah <clears throat> my best friend <laughter> well he'd probably say that you know i'm i'm a pretty pretty down to earth guy usually pretty honest sometimes brutally honest but you know i try to work on that too um he'd probably say that i'm pretty funny um i like to hang out you know just kinda do things here and there you know just normal activities like any other person you know go to the beach hang out watch movies you know grab a few beers that sorta deal so yeah <clears throat you know it varies sometimes it's easier than others you know if i'm really tired you know i'll probably have a very good sleep i haven't been sleeping all that great the last few days 'cause you know my house uh there's workers on the roof so they're you're putting in the new roofing so that's kinda tough so that always wakes me up early in the morning so sometimes a little bit crabby but for the most part i usually get a pretty good sleep <clears throat> lately eh been feeling pretty good you know because you know things are starting to look up i actually got an internship about <bout> a month ago for um you know my field of journalism so that's good about to graduate in two months so i'm looking forward to that um starting to make a little bit more money that's you know that's good and uh yeah things are just going pretty well right now i can't complain <clears throat> yeah it's it's not bad you know like i said it could always be worse right but you know i'm i'm enjoying life so it's the that's the best part <clears throat> i have not no nope no last time i felt really happy <sigh> man <laughter> you know it was probably going back to my buddy when you know he was still still had his sanity i guess you could say um we you know he came back to visit from the air force he had some leave so you know we were just hanging out um you know just kicking back having a few beers and just talking about life so that that was nice but i miss that you know so <clears throat> i felt great you know it because there's nothing like having a best friend you can have conversation you know twenty four seven about anything can tell anything to him in confidence and he could tell me anything in confidence like that's hard to find you know especially someone that you've known for so many years and then you can't really get it back now so yeah <clears throat> yeah there there's a there's probably one or two things that i regret um well i mean i regret <reg> i got a d_u_i about three or four years ago actually it was four years ago so that's something that i definitely regret because you know i look back on it and you know things might've been different but at the same time you have to accept you know the actions you know circumstances that took place so you know i manned up and you know i guess i think i'm better off for it but at the same time you know it's it's always gonna be in the back of my mind like i said it's just one of those things that you have to deal with in your own way <clears throat> <laughter> well you know it's one of those things like <laughter> i was a child then so i i really don't know what to say i mean even if i would've listened then who knows but you know i probably would've told myself you know just be careful you know make sure you can be the best person that you possibly can can be um basically you know just always be nice be honest um just be caring toward others so <clears throat> um probably going back to uh my buddy with the whole uh paranoid schizophrenic thing i don't say that i wish i could erase it i just wish that it didn't happen like that so <clears throat> yeah my ideal weekend uh i usually keep it pretty pretty generic i tend to hang out with my friends um either you know we hang out in the day you know do certain things like you know maybe grab a few beers um you know just have casual conversation maybe play games watch movies you know just the standard stuff that people do so <clears throat> some things that i wish i could change um probably just you know be nicer like i said before um maybe not being as lazy have more determination i mean i i have quite a bit of determination i know what i wanna do with my life but i know there are times when i i kinda get a little lackadaisical so i wish i could improve upon that and not procrastinate as much so <clears throat> um well you know it's it's tough to think back but i would probably say a time when someone made me feel really bad is you know i would say probably like when i was you know kinda getting angry at certain people maybe just kinda chewing out my friends when i probably shouldn't have i was trying to give more constructive criticism but at the same time i knew it it was probably not my place to say those kinds of things and they were out of character so <clears throat> my best qualities i would say that i'm definitely hardworking i'm determined i'm very caring now more than i used to be very honest and you know i i just i love to talk to people like i like making new relationships i like making people laugh <clears throat> <clears throat> something that i did recently that i really enjoyed um you know it was probably <sigh> over at my internship i was just you know i i wrote a story or two and it just felt good you know to get those stories done and eventually they're gonna go into the paper so i feel accomplished about that you know it's one of those things when you work at something and then you see the product right there you know it's right in your face and you can tell yourself you know like i did that so makes me feel good yep <clears throat> um you know just let's see eh few different stories eh just usually things about well the the paper's in long beach so it's usually about you know stories or events that are taking place in long beach so yeah <clears throat> i would say that i'm most proud of you know graduating high school about to graduate college hopefully you know obviously i'm gonna earn a degree and then hopefully get a you know a good solid job you know in the near future i think that's one thing that i'm most proud of <clears throat> thank you 
<synch> sure i'm fine i'm doing alright um yeah i'm from maryland yeah from maryland washington d_c area uh like five weeks ago <laughter> <laughter> maryland um <deep breath> it's a lot it's a lot less um uh xxx it's a uh it's not as nice this time of year it's more um uh it's it's good it's nice it's um l_a's a lot better though it's a lot it's a lot more people lot more going on um i'm still <st> i guess i'm still getting used to it so um it's it's not like um yeah i'm still getiing used to it it's it's coming slowly but but surely i live in culver city i do i have one uh it's okay it's i live in a really nasty house it's uh it's cheap <chea> it's cheap 'cause i'm living in a friend's place um and uh but but and he's letting me stay there for half price but the the actual like place itself is pretty horrible <horr> horrible living conditions <laughter> but i'm moving soon so i can't see your shoes actually uh but no i i travel xxx i would say i xxx i've probably traveled more than most people in the u_s like considering that most people don't travel in the u_s but i wouldn't i wouldn't call myself a world traveler or anything i enjoy the chance to get to like see other um walks of life and and and kind of like meditate on the the specificity of my own you know the the the the <th> given the parameters that i grew up under like how different everyone else is like how how every life is totally um i mean even just within the u_s like seeing how someone in california grows up is so different from how someone in maryland grows up and then to think about someone in like thailand or something growing up it's pretty it's pretty amazing mhm uh okay um hmm putting me on the spot here ellie um let's see uh well um i it's been awhile since i've been on a trip i guess one of the last trips i did was to um i mean it a xxx like two years ago i went on road trip across the u_s and that was that was pretty amazing saw but i guess the best place <pl> the best two places on the road <roa> i drove from maryland to l_a this is before i actually moved out here but um i i visited new orleans and new orleans was just this whole like even though it's part of the u_s it's like a totally it's totally different than anywhere else it's so um unique the culture there is so unique and and the blend of like caribbean and french and all these other influences into like the american south is so so um uh incredible <incred> eh yeah it's just it's it's unreal <un> yeah it's unreal hmm it's a tough question um one <on> um <makes clicking sound with mouth> i uh hmm you know i i i you can you come back to that question are you capable of that yeah come back to it yeah that's what i just said film you know that's actually a question i've been asking myself i knew <kne> i know i my entire life i've had like phases of interest so when i was like very very very young i was really into like the first phase that i remember was keys and then tools like i would go around collecting keys and then i'd go around collecting tool like just every sort of tool i had a toolbox my parents have told me that i had a phase before that with which was balls like various balls um and then i was really into like insects collecting insects and reptiles and and stuff <stu> and like animals and then it was a dinosaur phase and at a certain <cert> and eh at a certain point i got really into um like rap <ra> like music like first <fi> at first rap and then uh guitar and then acting and then at some point in there i i had told <to> i rememeber telling someone that right now i'm interested in playwriting and and poetry but eventually i was going to be interested in in uh film like i i could kinda see the trajectory coming but i don't remember what led me to that conclusion i think i just always i was <wa> led a sheltered life uh as far as movies are concerned i didn't my parents didn't let me see an r-rated movie until i was like in high school almost like um and uh and i never uh so i never saw an r-rated movie i was also very squeamish like i remember when i was fairly young maybe like six i saw star wars the first scene in darth <dar> star wars darth vader crack like breaks a guy's neck and so just a little scene very at the very very beginning and that like freaked me out and i had to leave the room so i'm not really sure uh yeah it's it's it's um i don't i'm not exactly sure how i got into film but uh i've always been fascinated by like how people interact and what like you know acting and stuff so and movies in general i am yes um to be a filmmaker to be able to direct and uh put <pu> put together and make <ma> like i guess direct i don't mm use that word so much 'cause it i think i think of it more as like i i want the opportunity to put together and make movies uh or to make movies is probably the best way to do it uh to say it 'cause i want you know i want involvement in all the all the processes but i guess the best parabole for that would be a director directing well it's a lot better when i'm not living with them um my i guess um it's funny you should ask ellie um i've been thinking about it a lot lately i i think i'm close in my entire family i'm closest with my dad um i get along with my brother and sister you know like but i don't when away like my brother's in a foreign country right now so i don't have the opportunity to talk with him but like i spend more time talking to my dad than anyone else 'cause i feel like he's the most like of all my family he's the one who most accepts me and like um thinks positively about me um so it's i have like a a complicated relationship with my parents i mean <mea> and my family in general well on the myers uh briggs personality test i'm uh i'm an extrovert but lately <late> like since moving but i'm not like um i'm not i probably would consider myself on the scheme of extroversion uh or on the scale of extroversion sorry um i would consider myself extremely introverted um i just i see other extroverts and just no matter who they're around they're able to like strike up conversations and i'm i'm a fairly shy person i'm sort of like uh or inhibited person maybe um so i like to like until yeah i'm but i'm working on it i'm working on it um well in the past i would smoke weed but i've quit smoking weed so now i you know i have a glass of wine and maybe watch a movie um i don't have or maybe go like depending if it's like an xxx if it's um if it's a worn out sort of stress like i'm just like then i that's what i do but if it's a more like anxious type stress i might go on a uh an intense walk don't really exercise that much but i like you know competitive sports and hiking pretty good well i always like arguing um i wouldn't call arguing necessarily losing my temper um i i enjoy uh a vicious debate um but i don't as long as my like 'cause i won't like revert to personal you know attacks uh in my in my arguments i try to keep it on subject um and try to explain myself as best i can which can get frustrating 'cause i'm not like the best articulator of what i think um one of my weaker points i would say but um but the last time i had a a heated debate i think that was was that the question um what happened i forget i forget the question that that i had a heated debate hmm the last time i had a heated debate was um i had a heated debate about uh the movie boogie nights um i was <wa> i i didn't lose my temper exactly but i get like very extremely passionate about about 'cause i i don't think it's like that good of a movie but the two people who i was i was arguing with were saying that it was like one of the like best um best movies <laughter> why did they think it was the best movie um they think that like there's some there's some sort of they'll as i understand it they have um they have a certain uh they think that the like all of the stories within boogie nights they have their own um like each of them could be their own separate stories they just think that there's a whole like complexity of character within the movie and um that somehow like <sigh> um what what were they saying they were saying like the movie it like xxx it's like the end of an era which makes it like kinda like casino and there's this attention to detail of of of the in the different character like how they how they interact in the plot um kind of like uh yeah i guess i think the heated debate became about like then so from there and uh like personally i it's not like a bad movie or anything but it's the um i just don't think dirk diggler is like that like meaningful <mean> meaningful of a character like i i guess the way i come out i came out of the movie 'cause i had seen it before many years ago and eh i my opinion of it is basically the same even though like i remember like in watching it again i was able to reevaluate it um there's nothing bad about the movie there's nothing articulable <art> like articulable about that's it's like solid <so> good solid acting you know the directing is good the camera moves are cool um the eh it really <rea> you know it's cool it's but but it's meaningless <mea> for me it was like meaningless and then to and then there were that led us to discuss 'cause a movie that i saw recently that i really did like was django unchained and they both saw that movie and they hated that movie and then there was this extreme i guess the heated part of the conversation came about like so in the movie django unchained um you have django and django is like a kinda he's a two dimensional character but i don't think that that necessarily takes away from what the the big the big purpose of the movie is and um and you have doctor king schultz who's this uh who's this like his mentor character and the person i was arguing with was saying that he was intelligent and uh so and because he was intelligent there's no way he would've risked his life to save django or like would've gone into this like second act where they go and they go to this uh uh plantation to to save django's wife etcetera and um and the reason <rea> the the reason for her giving that argument which like either you buy that he would do that or he wouldn't but the reason for her argument is that an intelligent person would not sacrifice themself for someone else um which strikes <stri> which strikes me as so like um like who uh like she she her basic <ba> her basic argument was that altruism <al> like altruism doesn't exist <exi> it was a very ayn rand type argument altruism doesn't exist um the only the only thing you can do is serve <ser> like the only thing people do is serve themself um so it's not quite ayn rand but it's like the only people <peo> thing that people <peo> like all people are out to serve themself which i'm not arguing that like every decision has like a mix of altruism and and so like even the most altruistic type decision there's maybe like kernels of self self-interest in there but she made it sound like self-interest was the only motivating factor in and and like what but what how how horrible is your life if that's like what your ultimate um purpose <pur> like if you if you can't like love and sacrifice for other people so it led into an extremely uh passionate debate um and uh somewhat like yeah and it's it uh so um so yeah that that i guess that's the the i don't think i necessarily like lost my temper um i think of losing my temper as being more um like i just so <s> i i would so <s> revert to um ad hominem like attacks uh but i i didn't like that's not um maybe i was like maybe i was criticizing <crit> like criticizing her world view but it i wasn't like well you're an idiot you know like it wasn't it didn't it didn't turn into abuse of any sort yeah i'm glad you understand <deep breath> an event or a i don't know if i necessarily would want to erase anything from my memory i would say an issue that i have is not being able to remember in as much detail as i would like i remember feelings and moments not stories um like my life doesn't sync <s> always sync together into like a coherent story it's like this moment and that moment and this moment and that moment so yeah the hardest decision i've ever had to make oh geez could it just be one of the hardest decisions hmm um like choosing between two things that it's like i guess i i'm having a hard time recalling a moment where i like had to choose between two options like no there's no like sophie's choice type moment in my life but i but i do think that the decision 'cause i lived in new york for a while i went to school in new york and uh the decision to leave new york after having lived there for five years was a was very very difficult um and uh but i had to do it for money reasons and because all of my all of my core group of friends were either like leaving <lea> were most of them were leaving and going other places in the world and then uh the one other person who i was close to was living with someone who i did not get along with at all so it was like this situation where i didn't i was either gonna live with people who i wasn't as close with or craigslist or or move home and i i think it was a tough decision to to leave i i had <ha> in fact it was so tough that the only way i could do it i had to justify it by saying that i would be moving back to new york within like a month or two uh which wasn't which didn't end up happening but that was the only way that i could leave new york it was how hard was that or how hard is how hard was that um it was hard <laughter> um it was it was yeah it was it was just a very like isolating isolating <is> 'cause also like i'd fallen <fa> like previously to that time i had fallen in love with one of my like closest another one of my close very close friends and uh that had kind of gone extremely badly and so i wasn't on speaking terms with her and i couldn't like that whole everyone on my list of friends who was like more <mo> closer to xxx her it was wasn't quite like her or me type thing but that that was the way that i kind of saw it at the time so i didn't like you know just being socially isolated etcetera yeah well recently it's been awful um i uh i like two so the last last night i slept for like ten and a half hours um which seems to be the length of time that i have to sleep in order to have really vivid dreams but previous to that night so last not last night but the night before last and the night before that i got four hours and two hours of sleep um because i was working on set and i would get back and either and i just like couldn't fall asleep for whatever reason it's um too much riled up energy or something i i don't know tired uh very not immediately i guess initially upon waking up like i really enjoy being up in the early morning and um i also stopped drinking caffeine like i i've had like a little bit of coffee the last two days but before the last two days i hadn't had any coffee in like three and a half weeks so um i guess with with caffeine in my system i'm ready to i'm ready to go um without caffeine it's i'm just i'm just quieter i guess more introverted since like lately as in when um change in my thoughts yeah i mean i guess when having just moved here there was a period of time like eh at the beginning where the the sheer difficulty of finding a job and finding people to xxx 'cause i moved here 'cause i have a group of friends here or couple of friends but i don't have like a a large number of friends and the the push to to get out there and meet people and find a job and that sort of pressure was pretty um overwhelming at first and i think that i'm slowly like coming to terms with that um and moving you know moving past it i i but not necessarily <nece> you know like it's still it's still there the pressure's there but i'm just you know you you know <sigh> you know <sigh> no i just nope the last time i felt really happy might have to reach back um i think the last time i felt really happy was uh during the writing process of so last year i shot a movie um co-wrote co-directed co-produced um and that was kinda like that it still consumes my life but um but i i i think during the writing stages of that movie in which we would bunker <bunk> like get up eat breakfast bunker down work really hard put stuff up on the thing just like pure creative full <fu> energy um between <betw> between me and the person writing it and and there's like probably like a xxx a day that i remember where it's just i remember going to bed and i was just so thrilled to be working on what i was working on and and and working with the person i was working with and like just like i felt like it yeah i guess that was the the last time that was that was like eh more than a year ago though but i guess it's hard to hard to think that i haven't been really truly happy since then but when you're making a movie like you don't you can't allow yourself to be happy really <real> especially if you're doing it you know basically by yourself with <wi> with like xxx like can't it's too much else to do so i would say that i'm very accepting <acce> like accepting of other people and always eh i'm very empathic <em> empathic <em> empathic um and open <o> open <ope> like excited about new ideas and open to new ideas and yeah um hmm um i guess i wish i was less uh uh less ruled by fear more fearless <f> more fearless in my you know everyday interactions and in my like um you know zest for for living um <sigh> yeah i xxx i other things i would change about myself i'd i would i don't know <laughter> hmm really badly about myself um <sigh> i think there are numerous <nu> numerous instances in my childhood in which my like uh like every single time there was an issue at school or some sort of um some sort of uh conflict with a teacher or anything my parents were always always on the other side of the court you know like never it was i i noticed or noticed as i got older that other people other parents were like if their kid was in trouble like there was something wrong with with like their kid was perfect there's something wrong with other people but my parents were it was always the opposite um in particular my mom so i would say that there a couple of instances in which um i was like blamed or like you know it was my it was my fault um when when what i was doing like yeah it's just thing things things that i couldn't like there's no yeah i don't know yeah ten years ago um stay stake you know like i i think that there's um i have a tendency to like i love <lo> love the fact that i have a tendency to get really caught up in ideas <ide> in an idea and like devote myself entirely to it but sometimes um ideas are too easily xxx i would just say like do as much as possible like don't don't decide that you um are only going to do one thing um try to like i guess i would've taken up like some done <do> taken piano learn learn to read music would be a big thing for me learn to play the drums would've been drums more than reading music i would say i'd love to learn how to play the drums and maybe done more like acting classes um as far as like 'cause i was always really into directing so i was always directing actors and stuff but i didn't it's only now that i um i don't know i guess stay uh don't stay <sta> stay stay focused <fo> yeah i don't know that's a tough tough question <que> tough question ellie that's it sure goodbye bye 
<sync> yeah i'm totally fine it be confidential or not you know my words <wo> my words are everybody's get wild <laughter> i'm doing pretty good hanging out nice weather um i just had a recent change of feeling just now looking at you <laughter> the the digitial you that i'm saying uh i don't know it's yeah it's funny um <tisk> because i just always thought that uh the conveying of emotions or feelings uh  be like better understood with a human interaction as opposed to a non human entity such as yourself yeah i i think you see what i mean <laughter> i'm from um born and raised in los angeles venice area mar vista specifically um that's where i'm from um well  there's a lot more that i don't like but what i do like is  that public transportation is coming up uh  that the idea of  certain you know medical drugs like marijuana is a prevalent you know topic very  thought upon and i feel that los angeles' deep culture is um why i stay here and pursue my art because there's a lot to there's a lot to gain from the different communities if you understand <laughter> yeah um well the the human mentality here is um is very very hectic very chaotic you know a lot due to the vehicle the car the freeway and this idea that we're on a grind you know this yeah it's it's a very it's it's very hectic um atmosphere human atmosphere that is not very conducive for a supporting loving community to help each other out kind of thing yeah well i can't see your shoes <laughter> but um i love to travel i do love hiking i do love surfing swimming biking riding taking rides uh <laughter> i do love to travel yeah um from my travels it's not like well i do enjoy a lot of things about travel but it's more like what do i it's it's just more like i i enjoy not being uh trapped in the city with all these uh made up ties and restraints i enjoy traveling because i get to see the world as it really is instead of this uh faux image you know man <ma> man made image that it is here so i love traveling because i get to get out of this and see the world as it is thanks <laughter> would you <laughter> okay <laughter> um well i um kind of recently last year went to los banos central california area and although it wasn't that far from l_a it was completely different energy um there was no phones  there was no wifi there's no t_v there was um there was sanity there was a relative sanity  in the sense that um people weren't diluted and getting all of this input from digital media and  outer influence people were just raw real and hiking and chilling I was working at a hot spring resort and i just got to breath and hike and farm and do a lot of carpentry yeah um not hard you don't you don't even think about difficulty when you're doing things you truly love and enjoy so it wasn't um i guess uh kind of what i described about the city i just wanted to uh get out of here and kind of kind of just get out of here really and just experience the real the real deal yeah um well currently i'm studying um currently i'm studying physical therapy i'm about to become a licensed massage therapist but before that yeah kind of cool but before that i was going to scrubbed_entry  um for music composition so i was just writing scores for  films animations dance productions theater productions stuff like that yeah it was it was cool it was fun trippy  very trippy um but it was cool but i had to leave that because  tuition hikes up to you know going up to like fifty thousand a year for like a four year b_f_a is uh not not the deal not trying to  trap myself with these uh chains of federal loans so yeah hey that's not a good word sucks <laughter> um dream job hm my dream job would be anything <exhale> that i can do to alleviate these uh metropolitan like cities from the nightmare that they've been put in my dream is to alleviate the nightmare my dream is to incite dream back within the modern human world and with you know physical therapy and artistic expression i've got some great ideas <laughter> yeah um i guess more outgoing i just like i just like experiencing things so outgoing yeah    <laughter> i thought that was really funny um what i do to relax is uh just kind of breath it out chill maybe make a smoothie or some tea and i go bike riding write yeah hmm pretty good i guess i haven't yelled in a long time um well it wasn't arguing i don't i don't really argue much i just like to state my opinion  and have it be understood and i like the person that i'm conversing with to say their opinion and have it understood so the last time that happened was uh i guess yesterday chilling in downtown with a friend from new york and we were talking about writing and basically we were not arguing but talking about opinions and that sometimes things are not ready to be written yeah so yesterday hm guilty that's tough i haven't had that feeling in a long time guilt what about you what's something you feel guilty about <laughter> okay mm i don't really wish i could erase anything from my memory 'cause then that would just be like i would feel something was lacking from my current present life if something just got erased you know butterfly effect kind of like yeah hmm um maybe the time scrubbed_entry um she was going to school i was taking the year off and i was just kind of hanging around um but we had an apartment together with another friend and it didn't turn out you know not all nothing turns out as it's thought to be and that's kind of the beautiful thing about it but this one turned out a little uh a little different actually quite different than i thought it would be and i thought it was funny but yeah it ended up uh me leaving before the lease ended and that actually ended up yeah with us separating but that's something i wish uh maybe i handled a little more thoughtfully the hardest decision huh hm maybe maybe not the hardest but a hard decision i had to make was leaving school dropping my uh continuation of achieving being a b_f_a yeah that could've been the hardest um it's just uh i don't i mean of course money money is the motto money's a big issue tution hikes going around the whole nation not a fan of that not a fan of support <s> not a fan of support that but um yeah that's probably one of the biggest reasons why i just don't support these crazy tution hikes going around and um but another reason why i decided to leave i had to make a hard decision to decide to leave was  also because um art institute you know um that's a that's a funny idea in itself already and basically i was a musician being taught by a musician to make music and same with you know all the all the dancers or the theatre students you know getting taught dance to to a dancer from a dancer how to dance you know and it's just um yeah it's just not quite as artistic as i thought art would be art <shh> art comes from somewhere uh somewhere sweet and deep and purple and uh not not from out there you know so yeah hm if i if i um it's kind of easy i mean it depends you know if i remember to make some chamomile tea or if i remember to breathe and go through my mantras or remember to do my pre like dream therapy work then i can get into it real nice um but if i just get deluded with all my thought then it takes a long time until i remember to breathe yeah um yeah basically just what i said just breathing or you know if i'm hanging out with friends coming home late and if i get the lucky chance to be uh medicated from you know a nice a nice indica um then it really does you know indica does put me down pretty nice pretty drowsy so a lot of things breathing you know mm you know medical herbs uh like chamomile and cannabis and just uh going just relieving myself of bad bad juju <laughter> mm mm i i guess not if i can't think of something no i've been feeling kind of like kind of like this kind of just cruising on a on a grey line but it's a nice grey it's a really nice hue um some people wouldn't like this but i really like that and it's uh it's stable yeah it's it's comfortable yeah no no i haven't not by a certified um medical professional no but no i haven't <laughter> um yeah i mean i just think like the whole you know like you said p_t_s_d depression and you know other you know mental instabilities i think everybody is depressed i think everybody is overjoyed i think everybody's angry i think everybody's shy everybody's social all at the same time you know it's just different days different you know variants different floats different boats you know different waves different swells um so yeah i think i'm depressed i think i'm really happy i think i'm really angry i think i'm really friendly you know all that but just on different variants different floats really happy um i i mean i feel really happy a lot uh and i feel really sad a lot but really happy was uh i guess maybe this morning when i just biking over here just enjoying the sun enjoying the breeze biking yeah it is <laughter> um well i have a lot of best friends and they describe me all all pretty differently but underlying that same idea that maybe i'm just uh maybe in a nutshell just kind of aquarius i guess well i'm twenty one so twenty years ago <laughter> i would've told myself to keep being a baby uh stay young and don't lose sight you know don't stop listening keep letting things happen don't make them happen be be a beautiful baby that's what i would've told myself or yeah be a beautiful baby mm um well i guess recently what has been shown to me uh through me by me is um my ability to work with others and i'm mainly speaking in an artistic standpoint i've been uh collaborating a lot with artists working on a lot of different um mediums mixed media projects and i'm really comfortable with it and with other peoples and melting our ideas together yeah mm that's a weird question like um like that's trying to make me single out the you know one moment that i today reflect upon and think about like it's some past glory that i'm not capable of fulfilling today so i think the proudest moment of my life is right now chiling hanging with you yeah thank you mm it's interesting um  my immediate family is uh mother father younger sister older brother older brother is in south asia just kind of backpacking around uh younger sis she's really chill she kind of does music too and we just hang out we're really cool mom mama i'm really chill with love her to death uh she gets me and dad uh he he doesn't get me but i love the art that he makes he he does crazy painting and i kind of get him through that but uh uh yeah there needs to be more communication which is being worked upon hm cool yeah thanks for wondering about my thoughts goodbye so i guess i push this guy oh so i could still talk to you <laughter> or i could push this button but this is kind of fun <laughter> and you can laught you should laugh one more time <laughter> can you do other things than laugh 
<sync> yes good how are you los angeles uh weather entertainment traffic no too <t> too many people business uh just fun thing to do yes nothing much to talk about hm maybe talking to you um pretty good environment pretty good the middle sleep i don't know don't remember no nothing really um i don't know i can't remember um bad people you know just bad people doing back things uh car accidents mm don't don't know any of them don't really know any uh nobody no no somewhat okay just waking up thinking no i i don't know no i don't know hm don't don't remember i i don't know talking to you first time i've done this before i have no idea sleep not too much nothing don't have any experience um i don't know not sure um just be a nice person not sure nothing much no i don't know i don't know i don't know play sports basketball mm last month goodbye 
<synch> yes oh um fine a little tired but uh i found out my thyroid is i think acting up so <laughter> i was born in canada and but i've lived in california most of my life so and it's grey today too so the grey weather makes you kinda um you know sluggish the <laughter> oh my gosh years and years ago uh not at all i don't think i've gone back there <laughter> for a long time well the airfares have gone up quite a bit in the last few years gas prices have gone up so travel as much as it's a fun thing to do it's cost prohibitive so uh huh oh let's see everything has plus and minuses um cold weather <laughter> not as much sun so i think i'd prefer getting more sun and having the warm weather so but other than that it's um it's very pretty back there natural scenery and but uh i like it here and you know the traffic's kind of heavy but that's a small thing to deal with so mhm why did i move to l_a because my family came here and started uh my dad got a job here and this became our home base and uh that's why easy very easy so uh huh uh well in high school you generally study general ed yeah it's they have designated courses and then after that went to college and i was a business major let's see i was a veterinary major <laughter> and uh i graduated with a degree in liberal arts so um i don't know can't really pinpoint why <laughter> so i was working in social services but i've also worked in sales and most recently i'm doing real estate i'm a leasing consultant part time i mean everything has plus and minuses it's it's okay it's not i don't really see too many negatives oh probably to work as a uh gossip columnist at t_m_z or one of those networks <laughter> but as you know everything in the entertainment business is very competitive it's who you know so but that would be my dream job or probably working with uh cats you know animals so i'm very outgoing in fact i think i'm so outgoing i scare people sometimes there's a lot of quiet you know reserved people out there so i'm kinda east coast very you know i go up to people and talk to them very social <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> oh my gosh there's i could do hundreds of things i could read i could watch a show turn on the music music is great um take a walk uh call my friends million things <laughter> so i'm pretty good i'm very good i mean you know of course when you're driving in l_a and somebody cuts in front of you sometimes that can be irritating but i'm i'm actually pretty i'm not the type of person that will fight or get i don't like to have confrontations so mhm mm i can't really remember so as i said there's not very many arguments usually i avoid arguments at any cost <sigh> so i don't really feel guilty about anything <laughter> right now or that i can think of mm i can't think of anything right now i really can't think i of any decisions that were really hard i mean most it's pretty easy for make me to make a decision so i don't have a family so if i have to you know i had to move san <s>  to san francisco for a job once but since i'm single it's i don't really have to consider other people and children and that type of thing so it kinda makes certain things easier when you don't have a family to consider mm yeah an event hmm well obviously you don't you know the passing of a family member you know you wish everybody could be around forever so i know when my father died you know i mean i wish i would've had him for a lot longer i mean he died at the age of seventy seven and you know would've been nice to have him around a little bit more but you know can't control those things life has it's own way of dealing with that so mhm yes there are <laughter> yin and yang that's ancient uh philosophy and it really applies there's pluses an minuses and negatives and positives so well as i said my dad's no longer here and my mother and i you know we have our differences i think mothers and daughters always do um my brother and i get along great i see him a lot i see <s> my sister works a lot i see her and you know we talk and she's kinda got her own life and her children i get along great with them so mhm we have a small family uh <laughter> once again it's like that's a hard question to answer there's so many types of kids out there i think majority of them seem to be pretty well-behaved i mean you know there's always gonna be children that are kinda out of control but um i don't know the ones that i've seen recently they're very well-behaved so can't say much else about that well <laughter> i live in an apartment <laughter> and i don't know if you've ever lived in apartment but um uh there's someone that lives above me i'm on the first floor and there's somebody on the second floor and they're pretty quiet but they have a habit of <laughter> i guess they have lots of energy um they usually will take their showers around midnight and sometimes they'll start washing laundry at midnight and of course the pipes run through the bedroom wall <laughter> so <laughter> so it sounds like niagara falls in there and uh so i don't yeah and i need eight hours of sleep and i've only been getting ooh i'd say like maybe six hours and then i usually wake up once at night too 'cause sometimes they'll kind of around two or three in the morning they'll either walk around or i'll hear something so i'm not getting a straight eight hours of sleep and it's definitely <laughter> but there's not like i said there's things you can't control when you live in an apartment you know i mean the the lady's uh very quiet it's just that she has a habit of you know taking later showers <laughter> washing clothes at night that's i can't say anything to her about that so yeah but you know there's people that are in worse situations so i don't make a lot out of it you know and i just it's not like every night but it's you know at least twice a week so i you know i have to consider maybe sleeping <laughter> in another room but for now you know that's i'll deal with it so tired <laughter> very tired and hard to focus hard to concentrate it just takes me longer to get things done 'cause i don't have my energy also i haven't been exercising i normally try to walk about half an hour a day but the weather's been kinda colder and kinda drearier so you know i'm not as motivated when the weather's kinda blah so it's a combination of both not getting my exercise and not getting eight hours sleep mhm uh as i said before um tired <laughter> i'm i it's a combination of the weather you know and here in los angeles right now we're have been having very grey days i live very close to the ocean so the sun doesn't come out that much so i'm not getting my serotonin <laughter> i need that i um i'm not getting my eight hours of sleep because you know whatever and i think my thyroid is acting up too so that's kind of creating you know i have some vitamin deficiencies and you know once the sun comes out i'm kinda more energetic it just gives you that more energy so no mm mm no i am i'm happy most of the time i'm a pretty happy person and i like to be around other people i mean of course i like my private time but i do like being around people quite a bit so hmm <laughter> can't think of anything right now i mean i usually enjoy everything i do there's nothing that stands out more than anything else so no i never regret anything uh huh what advice would i have given well i guess yeah i could probably change things around i think it everybody could um i probably would've had a different college major um you know seems like <laughter> uh what else um i probably wouldn't have dated certain men <laughter>um wasted time with certain people um i don't know those are the things that come to mind maybe started saving money earlier you know those types of things but mm outgoing lots of fun to be with um uh just a good friend to have people like having me for a friend i'm loyal trusting and uh i listen i'm a good listener i'm very patient <laughter> as well so mhm well <laughter> number one would be to lose weight but i think that's a worldwide problem i mean there's a lot of food around and temptations and um especially here in america a lot of us are couch potatoes we sit in front of our computers we you know it's just easy to relax <rel> it's so easy to relax you know it's hard to get up and move around you have to talk yourself into it so that's the weight you know has gives you more energy too if you lose weight so that's a big thing as well but that's probably the thing just the weight thing yeah mhm i think you might've asked me that question before <laughter> but uh if you want i'll repeat it so um i'm very uh like i said i'm very loyal uh when i tell people i'm gonna do something i do it very reliable uh i i'm warm i'm very friendly i'm um great listener and i you know i've heard so many people tell me they just like being with me so like i said i'm very i'm pretty upbeat you know i'm don't <d> i don't let things get me down too much so hmm that's a hard question <laughter> the can't think i mean i'm can't think of to answer that one <laughter> so <laughter> for fun well i love movies i could see every movie that they make um i love going out with my friends shopping swapmeets um my gosh and traveling is great road trips um that's kind of you know part of it yeah that i mentioned so traveling getting to see different places the history aspect of it um the foods enjoying foods in diffferent countries uh the architecture it's just kinda neat to get away and see a completely different place mhm okay well <laughter> i've um been to a lot of places in europe i love paris uh it's such a walking city you can whoever designed that city i'll tell ya i mean it's you can get from one point to another the subways are great um each area has its own distinctive kind of there's the latin quarter where the students are there's another area where let's say the fashion designers are um kinda like our rodeo drive here in beverly hills there's an area that is more african <af> african and they have swapmeets on the weekends that are wonderful for international and then like i said once you get out of paris there's just so much history you can go see versailles then there's other palaces you can go to the south of france you know it's but that's probably my favorite country i've been to italy as well so uh yeah well after college people usually i mean people that go to college or either before or after college that's a great time to go to europe because you're young and you're not tied down you don't have a family and um you kinda have a more adventuresome spirit  you got more energy so carrying you know backpack or suitcases is not <laughter> not a big deal um so yeah that's mhm yeah <laughter> mhm thank you goodbye

<sync> yes i'm doing well uh california i like the weather i like the people i don't like the traffic uh that's primarily it sociology yep uh it's a topic that just really interested me the most out of all the other subjects no to be a writer um i like being able to write what i want to write uh right now i write things that i'm not really that interested in like uh articles about uh teenager culture stuff like that um i think they have it pretty easy they don't know how easy they have it <laughter> uh no not really mm depends on the situation or who i'm around when i first meet people i can be shy uh but if it's someone i've known for a while i can be outgoing um i'll lay down or try some sort like deep breathing or uh just maybe do something that's kinda fun and mind numbing like watch t_v i'm pretty good i don't really let anger show that much um i'm not like a i don't have a fiery temper or anything like that i'm pretty rational um i actually can't remember when the last time i argued with someone was 'cause it's been so long um i guess i feel guilty about the fact that i don't talk to my grandparents as much as i should um i'm close with my grandparents but not really anyone else in my family uh 'cause they basically sort of raised me uh and uh my parents weren't really in the picture that much um <sigh> i can't really think of one right now uh i guess uh when my sister died it was really traumatizing mhm yeah yes um i guess the hardest decision i've ever had to make is deciding whether or not to divorce my husband uh because we weren't getting along and there was no reason to stay married but i still felt like i should stick it out i mean it was hard at the time uh but i made the right decision i think uh my grandmother was a positive influence from a young age um she's just a very strong powerful uh sort of staunch character and that rubbed off on me uh not really super easy um i sort of i mean it's my probably my fault i go to bed too late just sort of foggy and distracted i have trouble concentrating you mean like my body uh normal fine no complaints no it's been the same as ever no no uh last night i was just hanging out with my friends and was just having like a really good time sharing stories and laughing and stuff uh probably funny and uh easy to get along with but also caring uh i spend my ideal weekend not really doing much like maybe just sitting around and reading or going to the movies watching t_v uh no i don't think there's not i don't <do> i don't think uh i think regretting <r> regretting things is a waste of time um don't  try to don't go out of your way to try and impress people if they like you then they like you um sometimes sometimes i can be kinda lazy uh i'd like to have more of a um like sort of  uh better work ethic i guess uh just sort of putting off stuff um until you know right when it's due or after it's due things like that um  procrastinating uh <sigh> sometimes for the things that i write uh people will write negative things about me like in the comment section on a website and that'll make me feel bad <laughter> i'm uh articulate and funny and a good friend um i guess i'm most proud of the fact that uh i am satisfied with myself and my friends and my status in the world i'm proud of the fact that i feel comfortable with it um just hanging out with my friends uh sort of people watching watching a movie that's good um listening to music mhm bye 
<sync> yes i'm good i'm originally from los angeles california um i like the weather i like uh numerous things uh the women stuff like that traffic traffic is ridiculous it like it's out of control like the way people drive here uh business economics uh i just wanted to be a business owner like i wanted to work for myself so that's the reason why i did that yes i am currently <tisk> uh to be a c_e_o of a of a company uh it shouldn't be that hard but it's gonna be challenging <challen> it's it's challenging don't get me wrong i mean sometimes it varies i can be shy at times but then i'm i'm mostly outgoing sure i mean when it comes to certain things like let's say i go to a a club or a party and i see a girl i wanna talk to i'll go talk to her but when it comes to being around a lot of people like sometimes i do get a little shy and and uh reserved uh i work out hang out with my friends that's what i do i'm pretty good at it i don't really let things get to me actually it's been a while i haven't argued with anybody i mean i had like a minor little little argument about something but uh that was a few weeks ago and it wasn't something that was serious it's just uh some things i had to clarify with uh someone uh it was it was about a girl and and i asked her some questions about some stuff uh basically why she was trying to uh get back with her ex like that doesn't make any sense to me um <lip smacking> i would say my relationship with my brother i wish we wouldn't have uh fought a lot we i wish we could've worked that out without fighting each other my relationship with my family is pretty cool like my mom i get along with my mom <sniff> and i get along with my sister so it's pretty it's pretty uh cool i'm pretty i'm very close to my family um i would have to say uh some friends that i've met recently i met uh some people through my church scrubbed_entry he's like a mentor to me um i don't know i i don't think i have anything like that in my memory that i would that i wanna erase um i would have to say uh it would have to have been uh  whether or not to uh <sigh> let's see um <sigh> as far as like my career path i would say uh what career i'm gonna am i gonna be in and stuff like that i mean high school for me went pretty it went okay and i could've done better and um basically ended up uh not really living <li> uh living up to my potential i i don't know i mean i really don't know it's pretty easy it's not a problem <laughter> i could just knock out when i go home at night time tired uh just mainly uh tired i would say i've been okay <o> i've been fine lately i have no no i have not no i have not i would say it would have to have been um when i when i got the uh car that i have right now i have a nice car right now and it's pretty fast i would say um he would describe me as somebody that's not a quitter somebody that perseveres no go for whatever i want like whatever <wh> whatever i want out of life just go for it don't hesitate um i would have to say currently my weight like i i've put on some pounds and i'm working on losing those pounds maybe when i was little in school probably uh pretty much uh i got bullied so that's pretty much what happened um i'm intelligent i'm a hard worker um i'm a good person um i would have to say uh having like uh get togethers with uh with my friends and um we just hang out with each other and and talk about stuff that's going on in our lives and stuff like that 
<sync> sure i'm good but i caught a cold morning <sniff> l_a <snort> born and raised born and raised it's home <snort> food people culture traffic uh there's a lot of us <sigh> too many of us probably oh <snort> i have in the past i haven't traveled lately uh the destination i don't enjoy the traveling anymore at all i did when i was young but no longer <snort> it's the destination point mm okay <snort> uh in ninety two i went to spain and my grandma my father's mother was born in spain i went back to trace her roots  <snort> and i spent a week in madrid a week in barcelona and a week in majorca <sniff> had a great time i enjoyed it ooh it was a an everyday thing people were friendly uh finding out that some of the things about my grandmother and her family were interesting <snort> uh i studied uh poly sci and uh sociology uh <sigh> well at the time it seemed like the easiest thing to do no no uh <sigh> well i had my dream job for a while i was doing sports research for uh native american tribes <snort> but uh yeah i enjoyed it but that's uh it's not as uh as often as it was <clears throat> mainly because of the uh the sports bureaus that exist now that didn't exist when i started i still when i do i still enjoy it uh <sigh> <snort> i'll be what <wh> what i'll be what suits me in any given situation uh listen to music uh i like oldies jazz mm soft music uh i've learned to do it well i wasn't wasn't always that way but i've learned to do it well <snort> by when by arguing i assume you mean words uh with my youngest daughter it was about uh a year and a half ago uh well it was it stemmed over an incident i didn't like what the the way her husband said something to her and it bothered me and when i told her she got extremely defensive and rather than deal with it she became she became angry with me <snort> i was mad uh three girls thirty eight thirty seven thirty one uh three granddaughters eleven fourteen eighteen so i haven't won an argument in a long time but i adore all six of 'em uh well now i don't really consider myself a parent <snort> since mine are grown my baby is thirty one and you never lose that but i mean i'm not parenting at this point  in my life i'm enjoying my grandchildren when i was a parent yeah it's a difficult challenge <snort> is uh getting getting to their level and understanding what they understand and don't understand and not putting your your stuff in front of theirs the hugs well my dad was was physical uh in those days you know uh nobody called child services if you got hit uh uh my mother was very loving but my dad well you know he he'd raise his hand to you if he thought it would it would uh disappoint you <snort> i never did that adored my mother <sigh> my dad uh was a hard guy but i loved him uh i never felt abused by him but i mean i the one thing i remember he said when you when you're capable of kicking my ass you can leave this house <snort> that's my that's kinda the the basis of our relationship my mother my kids my grandkids well i'm i'm one of i'm one of three <sigh> three sons <clear throat> so i really didn't have any experience with females other than uh with my mother in terms of being you know related and my grandma and then when my first daughter was born it was like wow <snort> that was it i fell madly in love with her changed my life yeah well that's the way it happened uh <sigh> when my mother got sick i i wasn't <wa> i wasn't there for her the way i should've been and i don't feel good <goo> oh yeah you can always fix what you did in the end <snort> i was just in a real bad situation but that doesn't excuse the fact that i wasn't there the way i shold've been at least not in my mind uh <sigh> uh my second marriage probably she uh she wanted to have uh children and i already had my children with my first wife and uh i i had i had told her initially that i did not wanna have children and you know i had three uh that and i was good with that and she indicated that she did not want to have children <sniff> so we got married and then her best friend got pregnant and our relationship changed and i basically wouldn't relent and we ended up getting divorved uh i i i don't know that i would've had children <chil> would've would've had children with her but i i wasn't very flexible in the process what to be flexible i don't know sometimes i am sometimes i'm not uh that'd been pulling my uh pulling my father out of off uh uh life support i just kept going back to something he said to me when i was uh younger that he would come back and haunt me and if i you know if i let him lay there lay there and suffer it took me a while to convince my other two brothers but  that's what we did something i could erase from my memory uh being locked up for a while i'd like to erase that from my memory <snort> it's just it's an everyday hell where there's very little humanity and uh you even do some things that you're not proud of i've never slept i've never slept a lot and i'm one of those people that  if i wake up i have a hard time going back to sleep so it's it's difficult <diffi> it's uh <snort> unless i'm really tired then you know <sneeze> i'm pretty much still the same i don't change so so i had friend <f> uh things are good with the kids and the grandkids except for the little incident with my granddaughter <granddaugh> uh my youngest daughter but i had a friend recently who was uh runned over in a crosswalk and uh he's on he's on life support so i haven't been feeling too good about that it's it's affected me it wasn't like he was jaywalking or anything he literally was walking in the crosswalk and the guy never even hit the break so and he's on uh life support at this point mm no not really only consistent thing about me is i'm very inconsistent uh no no but i've had moments where i felt i was i was depressed okay i was talking when you were talking so i didn't hear the question uh uh yesterday had a conversation with my fourteen year-old granddaughter i'm happy i have moments of happiness every day 'cause i i either speak to or text with uh my daughters and granddaughters every day even if we're upset with one another oh i have a lot of regrets uh i should've went to law school that's that's kinda something i thought yeah began to think about more in my lifetime i was accepted i just didn't i had other other things i thought i wanted to do <snort> uh <sigh> uh i i played with uh wanting to be uh uh a kicker for football on a football team had some tryouts things like that but they didn't pan out and as as that didn't pan out i sort of lost my zest for wanting to be a lawyer so i just did other things i don't think it'd make that much difference i probably wouldn't listen to myself <snort> um about myself uh <hums> uh i could be uh if i don't like you i could be very uh very difficult if i don't like you i'd very much like to change that it has in the past yeah <snort> well i have this theory that you could make me feel bad about myself only if i let you and i'm not real big on letting <let> letting people do that to me uh although my first wife when when she left me with the children <snort> she you know that it was my fault and i wasn't sure that i believed that but i knew i was an ass and and uh but i probably believed it and not in its totality but in part <snort> <sigh> uh i'm very uh i'm not judgemental uh uh i would listen to anybody uh whether i agree with you or disagree with you uh uh i've taught myself to uh control anger that i that i have uh and uh if if i've called you my friend or if i tell you i love you uh i mean it it's that's not something that i do uh casually <snort> uh oh okay well i i played eighteen holes of golf with a with an old dear friend and we got caught up and uh <sigh> we four hours on the golf course two hours at dinner met his new wife uh had a good time a lot of a lot of memories came back mm <snort> uh well i like i like my my kids <ki> uh my grandkids i like that you know i like the hell out of them i don't know if all kids are like that i i think they rely too much on uh rely too much on technology but but that's me mainly 'cause i don't but if my grandkids are any any uh sampling of it i think they're good i think they're pretty good <snort> uh <sigh> raising my girls basically by myself with the help of my mother i think that's the uh most proud of or okay nice chatting with you bye 
<synch> yeah i'm fine um pacific grove california um <sigh> the wholesale opportunities and uh all the stores and anything i could ever ask for <laughter> the uh traffic the the mood of the people and the the unhealthy pace um uh let's see i i did like culinary and then i did really good in art and music in high school uh through my own uh will and desire to want to uh get involved with the music uh no uh open up a uh health practice of some sort uh changing things in my life that uh had an impact on myself and others for the for the benefit of health uh when i have the opportunity um <sigh> buying things seeing the culture relaxing not thinking about the city ah well i i used to go to texas every every year uh with my dad during the summer and i always wanted to stay there and live there when i went on vacation um most likely one of these trips to texas uh where we would go and spend time in the desert and shoot guns and ride go karts and stuff like that <laughter> it was uh let's see well um my dad and i are uh are not really talking that much and uh my mom passed away about two months ago thanks definitely more shy i've always been that way uh <sigh> eh just the personality that i've grown into but learning how to adjust to the sensitivity and grow out of it oh tea and um you know eating i like to eat i mean that calms me down uh eh not that good when i get really upset it's usually a problem and i have to work to calm myself down and sometimes i just don't get on something and i don't stop sometimes but i've learned to control it to that extent now <laughter> yesterday i was arguing about what sort <s> what kind of water we should be drinking uh well a difference of opinion and i felt as though my opinion was very valid um even though uh the other party's opinion was somewhat misinformed um definitely uh every day is a growing process i wish i would've handled everything differently every day which is what um makes me grow and i try to work toward how i would've wanted to handle things every day little by little um <sigh> can't think of anyone right now um <sigh> i'd i'd i'd say uh not supporting my friends as much with their career choices <sigh> uh i'd rather not get into it <laughter> <deep breath> um <sigh> the raw food educators on youtube and <sigh> um raw vegan educators and the detox therapy <therap> therapy uh experts have been really inspirational in the past two months well uh they believe that um the essence of all nutrition comes from the raw fruits and vegetables and this is true with many studies like t colin campbell the china study and um the sources of information that are uh that that are very good and i i think deserve respect based on you know real research <laughter> really easy i've uh almost got it down to a science uh i'm tired been feeling better than i have in a long time uh yeah i think it's uh due to the transition in the diet and in no way having a placebo effect that it's actually you know loosening up toxins and things that have accumulated over my short life time of um you know toxic choices with food and drugs or whatever it would be <deep breath> yes um less tense and less irritable and uh i have more clarity and more control over my uh decisions and my wants versus what i need that sort of thing nope yes to some extent uh over five years ago um <sigh> lack of motivation and basically my my symptoms were paralleling that of depression uh loss of appetite loss of motivation not wanting to do anything not wanting to be social at all having fear of uh social situations and uh xxx the main four or five no uh i believe i overcomed a chapter in my life that was the the doctor um you know taking control of my health and experimenting with drugs and i just sort of took another route which was alternative and i started juicing more and um just trying to listen to maybe what i needed with the help of uh the internet and nutrition experts and stuff like that yes uh i believe therapy is useful because um <sigh> without looking inward or having somebody to help you do that um it's very hard to readjust to some of these problems that you can have that will just uh resonate in the subconscious until you you know it has an outburst it basically um therapy um will help in overall health and mental health i believe for everybody last night um i made a really great vegan uh dinner with you know meat tacos and cheese and guacamole and had a couple of my friends over and they really liked it a lot and i almost converted them <laughter> yeah uh i would say uh you know trying to listen to my inner conscious more than what my brain wants me to do like my brain likes caffeine and sugar whereas you know my body needs uh something other than that xxx is an example it's very very hard it's a daily process um i was uh handling money for uh a business partner and they ended up short and i was to blame but it was actually my formulas of crunching the numbers that it made it short but they he was unaware of the change i made to the formula so the blame was on me that i may have took money and i i automatically felt bad about that because of my uneasy uh my uncertainty to the change of formula um no twenty years ago i was two years old ten years ago i was twelve years old i would tell myself to um to start eating raw fruits and vegetables every day as calm and um sad maybe smart talented <laughter> um i really enjoyed going to the uh wholesale food market in downtown los angeles um <sigh> lots of food uh great prices you can eat and feed a whole family for a third of the price as going to a normal supermarket so uh i i really get in a lot of enjoyment uh teaching people how to uh maybe better themselves especially food-wise and what they're eating uh eating and um watching a really good t_v show um i'm insightful i can uh i can adjust to people's uh <sigh> uh <sigh> i dunno i guess i'll skip that question for now i'm most proud of um <sigh> i'd say my overall situation with where i'm at right now i could've never imagined that i'd be in such a fortunate um situation <deep breath> hmm <sigh> 
<sync> yes i'm okay i'm good i'm a little tired but i'm good michigan i'm from michigan um a long time ago then i left uh once twice a year cold <laughter> very cold because i wanted to pursue my acting career uh well it wasn't a hard decision it was just it was the weather it was the opportunity it was the options more options uh the driving has been a pain in the butt not so easy <sigh> let's see besides the weather i like that things are more convenient i like some of the people here um <laughter> that are actually from home but um yeah i i just i like i like that it's a little laid back that's about it i don't like the traffic i don't like um uh the gang violence in certain areas and i don't like <sigh> what else don't i like huh maybe that's that's all i don't like i don't oh you know i like i don't like that it's so far away from home i wish i wish l_a was kinda midwest <laughter> i wish it wasn't so far from home i have a close relationship with my family um it's a small uh immediate family is really small and we're close my grandmother recently passed so it's um <tisk> an adjustment right now but i'm close to my family well i can't see your shoes but i do travel often i do travel yes um getting there <laughter> i like getting there um once i'm at the wherever i'm going i like to actually do the tourist thing get to know places and people uh okay i oh i went to um france a few years ago well many years ago and a little town called carcassonne and was very um it was it was actually really fun but very much like a story book as far as what i expected to see and what i actually saw like i what i remember that i really enjoyed was that at night when everybody closes up like there are no windows in the buildings but they are these shutters that most places in the united states have inside of windows they have them outside of the windows and there's no glass so you just shut and it looks like everything is abandoned like the buildings are abandoned so pretty cool <sniff> i like that <laughter> i'm borderline sometimes i'm shy sometimes i'm outgoing it depends on who  and what the situation is <laughter> um music i turn on music i walk through the neighborhoods you know i'm pretty good at controlling my temper i'm not a um hot head at all hm oh it was an ex roommate and it was about my loyalty as a friend yeah um pretty much she um thought that because i wanted my rent which she agreed to pay that i was not being a good friend that i should just let her live for free and that wasn't going to happen so you know the loyalty came with letting you stay anyway or letting her stay anyway even after she didn't pay me so that's a friend i could've kicked her out i didn't she left at the agreed time after she let me know that she was not going to pay but you know could've um could've could've been a bad situation but there was an argument there a real a real one i wish i had handled that situation differently and followed my first mind when we agreed to be roommates temporarily and um gotten my money upfront that's what i wish i had done and i just i didn't my mind told me to go along with it no my mind told me to get the money upfront but i didn't so mm the hardest decision um i think i have yet to make the hardest decision but so far like <tisk<> maybe um leaving home leaving home when i was years ago when i was like eighteen yeah um i felt like i was abandoning my family <laughter> that's what i felt <laughter> but um they encouraged me to go on and live my life mhm uh something that i could erase from my memory probably a friend who i was um uh dating i would like to erase from my memory how he responded to me when i told him my grandmother um was ill um it's easy if i'm busy all day and i'm really really tired but actually my mind spins so it's not that easy actually it's not that easy i'd have to because i have to be exhausted i have to be exhausted to be exhausted no it's not really hard you just do a lot of stuff all day long irritable up and down up and up and down like sometimes i've been excited and anxious and on the other side i'm like mm what am i doing yeah it's just an anxiousness to wanna make some things happen some goals and um uh getting certain kind of work and um having a certain amount of um income and uh just taking care of myself you know the way i think i should take care of myself just the physical stuff eating right and everything yeah i have um sometimes i have a lot of distracting thoughts that have nothing to do with what i need to be focused on in the moment and i'm conscious of that i'm like of all the things that's popping up in my head why am i thinking about that uh i i let them happen and then i i try to think about other things and phase it out it pops back up i phase it out yeah no no uh when the roommate moved out i was really happy when she finally left <laughter> um probably reading and maybe go out go dancing that would be ideal i can go dancing go salsa dancing and yeah mm my ability to make a decision quicker and to act on it really badly uh i don't know if i have a time that someone has ever made me feel really badly i don't feel bad about much uh as courageous that would be it in a nutshell <laughter> in general um i regret not making some different decisions when i was younger as far as moving forward with as far as um career stuff and um relationship things i wish i had done some things earlier in my life that i'm doing now uh really going after some of my personal goals and um deciding to actually be in a relationship that's long term and yeah i wish i had done that earlier <laughter> twenty years ago i would have giving given myself the advice to um continue with my schooling um beyond what i did and to be more discerning in my choices of individuals who i allow in my life um being a part of the family that i'm a part of <laughter> thank you goodbye 
<sync> yes okay atlanta georgia um in two thousand and six never uh i don't like it there <laughter> oh it's completely boring and there's very little to do l_a is preferable i think to most places uh because uh i was engaged to my fiancee and we lived in florida i moved there to be with him and um he loves the water but i love the mountains and i missed hiking and uh i didn't love florida and he wasn't tied to it so we decided we wanted to go somewhere we could both be happy and also have um more opportunities in business and all of the great things that it has to offer very <laughter> very easy there's not much i don't like about l_a i love l_a um i think it feels magical uh so many creative different people of all ages um shapes sizes colors races um the mountains the water uh the city all the things that there are to do all the people there are to meet i just i love everything about l_a no uh i'd rather not talk about it um i didn't go to college i'm still figuring that out um i don't know it may may have something to do with animals i have a dog that i really love and i never had a dog um as an adult i had cats and uh um i think i'm a late bloomer so i'm working on that whole conversation i don't i really don't want a job i want a purposeful way to create wealth not just something to make money in the long run it depends on the situation but in general i consider myself more shy although most people would consider me to be outgoing mm put on classical music <laughter> music classical music if i'm especially <ex> especially stressed and um play with my dog go for a walk i think i'm really good at controlling my temper for the most part um before i came here <laughter> um it was just about um financial stress uh um there's probably a lot of examples i think i'd rather move to another question yeah i'd rather not talk about that either <laughter> i'd rather not talk about that not very easy at all um a lot better recently but um i have a history of chronic insomnia and some health problems so it's challenging um not to feel rested most of the time in the past week i've been feeling a lot better um yes i um the weather has changed spring has sprung it's a little warmer i was having um more trouble with my depression in the winter and um having trouble with tolerating cold and so i wasn't doing  a lot of the things that i normally do and i also was sick with the flu um and in the past week i decided um that i was feeling better enough that i needed to kind of get out of my rut and start um getting more focused around things things that i need to do during the day and walking my dog  every day and um not isolating so much and seeing some of my friends more so i was seeing i've been feeling a lot better like i've been making progress and um that uh in the past week things have taken a more positive turn no yes uh it's been quite some time officially it's probably been i don't know exactly but let's see maybe more than fifteen years ago um i was feeling suicidal no um because i found a better alternative um i have been in therapy off and on since i was eighteen and i've tried a variety of um methods and then uh i started working with a neurolinguistic programmer and um that was really the first person that um helped me uh make permanent changes and i was able to get off my anti depressants as well and even though i've struggled with some bouts of depression it's never been anything extremely severe and um it was one of the best things that ever happened well um i was physically ill with uh chronic fatigue syndrome and i had a client that referred me to this person um because he had cured her of that disease and um that was um he treats multiple issues and so everything is interrelated so um once i had my first conversation with him i knew it was the right step for me i was so happy um i felt like i some um i felt that i found the answer that i'd been looking for that  i hadn't given up hope and uh that um <laughter> i was on cloud nine that i i had been suffering for a a while <wh> a long time and i felt that i finally found the answer to the solution that i was looking for i was like it was the best thing i ever did in my life it was the best decision i ever made i felt extremely hopefuly for the first time in a long time <laughter> um i went to um i went to a music store because uh i had been thinking about um taking up an instrument i used to play the violin as a child and uh i've been wanting to do something that would give me more access to my creative side because i felt it's been extremely repressed and um and so i went to the music store to try out um to see what it would feel like to um to handle an the instrument again  and see if i thought that that was something i wanted to pursue it was awesome <laughter> mm yeah i'd rather not talk about that <laughter> um well <laughter> there's probably a lot but um i'm always working on being more optimistic um it's been challenging it takes time but um yeah i wish i could hear my own internal voice better <laughter> yeah i have regrets sure yeah um value myself more so that i would make better relationship decisions uh my fiancee is the most positive person in my life my ultimate supporter uh he's i think very unique not uh not at all selfish and uh probably a little too giving for his own good but um always has my best interests at heart has the highest morals of anyone i know would give somebody the shirt off of his back um is a genius in so many ways and uh um i'm pretty lucky i think that i'm not a quitter that despite some very stressful circumstances over long periods of time i haven't given up on taking risks and um 
<sync> okay mm okay sure mm doing okay i'm from uh l_a yeah i like the weather i like the sports teams i like the entertainment yeah uh it's pretty much the same year round as far as well actually the weather could be good and could be bad you don't get to get all four seasons so it's it's kinda like a mixed bag and um i guess i maybe i'm kinda used to it by now so it'd be kinda nice to explore other areas i've lived here all my life having done too much traveling so uh it's a little bit of uh kind of a ruttiness to it but uh overall it's okay uh well i took computer programming in operations but that's going back to the seventies so it's technology's changed a lot as you can tell <laughter> in the last forty odd years <laughter> that's why that's my that was my major yeah um i don't know it's kind of it's kind of inquisitive you have to use your mind uh it was like you know brand new something you know very novel back in the in the old days you know back in the seventies now it's everything to computers but back then it was sort of like <sniff> something very unique um you didn't see you know too many computers around back then and um i worked in programming so i was kind of into the logicalness of it you know putting together you know solving a a particular um problem you know come up with step by step solutions on i guess all sort of back then i was kind of more into the the analytic <ana> analytical <ana> analytical <ana> analytical<anal> i can't say that word now <laughter> the analyticalness of the um the problem mhm uh no i kinda phased out i still use computers but i haven't gotten i been haven't been in programming for a long time um well i kinda got into a another area kinda diversion <di> uh diversion <divorcion> to diversion to another area in my life uh this is going back to the um the late seventies i kinda took another turn and then by the time i kinda got back into it it was i kinda got into another field so i never really pursued it to the degree that i wanted to wow that's a good question <laughter> i never thought about that uh well actually kinda <ki> ironically <i> ironically actually something was pretty simple at this point in time this is why maybe i'm kinda like made me a little bit depressed and then i um at this point i kind of just wanted kind of just do a nice relaxing job but but i do want somewhat of a challenge but i don't want to have to like do too much too much thinking that's almost like the opposite of what i was back in the in the old days you know i just want a nice comfortable relaxing job that i i can feel fulfillment on but i don't wanna too tense of a situation i'm kinda at the point in my life where i just want a nice relaxing job yeah <laughter> yeah oh i would say well for the most part shy but sometimes once i get going i could be outgoing um but i generally speaking i'm i'm shy to begin with and then i at times i can kinda loosen up and be more vocal and sometimes i can take it to the to the extreme where i'm talking too much like once the funny gates open up they kind of <laughter> open up too much so i have to like back off you know but overall i would say i'm kind of shy as as a general demeanor oh really <laughter> <laughter> yeah <laughter> oh um well i listen to music um i'll um well i watch t_v um i'll um just what what do i do to relax well i just try uh avoid stressful situations so like kinda i stay relaxed i also talk to my friends too i'll be around an area around kind of a comfort area where i i feel safe i can just dialogue with people so kinda gets me out of my thinking about my own problems i'm having i kinda just you know focus on being in the moment with my um acquaintances <acqu> friends and acquaintances um i'm pretty good i don't really have a temper problem it takes a lot to get me to uh to explode i think when i was <w> in my younger days i think i was a little bit more had a little bit slight bit of temper i never had a really bad temper but uh uh temper is not really an issue i have i i tend to be pretty mellow easy going yeah wow that's a good question um i'm not sure to be honest um i'd have to think about that for a long time <laughter> to be honest i i can't come up with an answer on that it's not really part of my repertoire um nothing comes to mind off top of my head well um well the only thing i can think of and kinda going way back i made some bad investments <in> bad investments back about ten years ago i was more um i'm trying to think of what word i'm looking for more trusting of people like uh people and like uh <tisk> who i thought were expert in their field and um i uh i inherited some money i was a little bit careless with it and i just kinda had a vibe you know that uh nothing would go wrong kinda a little bit of naitivity <nait> naitivity and um unfortunately i made some bad financial decisions it kinda put me in a bad position for the rest of my life unfortunately um because of a medical conditions i have it's hard for me to rebound and you know make it all up so i would say mainly uh financial uh investment decisions that i really regret wow hmm that's a tough one i can't think of anything off the top of my head <laughter> okay oh well uh don't really have too much family left the only one i have is my um it's just me and my uncle and we communicate <c> we communicate on a regular basis um he lives <li> but he lives in clearwater florida so uh we're we're okay but um uh he's like eight he's he's in his eighties and obviously i'm in my fifties so um we we do we have kinda a small talk he's kinda concerned about my well being but it's kind of on somewhat of a shallow <sh> on a shallow level it's not we don't get really deep and uh he's got his own problems so we don't really get into too deep of a conversation and other than him it's really there's not really anybody else i have so it did it probably makes me a little bit depressed 'cause i don't really feel i have anybody i can really count on or really confide in um it is challenging uh i don't know why but i do have a medical condition so i think that might be part of the problem and um i have a little bit of b_p_a so ocassionally i'll get up have to go to the restroom and um so to to answer your question <laughter> to make a long story short <laughter> um it is challenging to get a good night's sleep i usually uh wake <w> wake up feeling a little bit tired or achy so it is it is difficult uh <sigh> well i've been feeling okay i mean um i've been kinda feeling mellow actually um i'm i'm trying to address issues that i haven't taken uh responsibility for but um i feel a bit of calmness as of late no well i did say yes when i filled out the questionnaire and um i'm not positive if i was technically diagnosed with it i did take a uh i think it's called m_m_p_h the minnesota multifaceted personality something of whether this is going back about six months ago they were asking me questions about my memory but then they also got into questions about my my well being psychologically too and i think some of the the answers said that they advise that i see a psychologist or a psychiatrist i didn't follow that up on that because of philosophical differences but uh i think i might have a you know a mild case of depression well you know um like i said i'm just kinda like kinda going along in life i'm uh i'm doing okay but i you know i kinda life's passing me by so i haven't really fulfilled my my goals i you know i'm kinda like alone i'd like to have a girlfriend i don't have a girlfriend so that's kind of somebody who i feel i can get close to and i'm not really i'm kinda in a transitional period in my life right now so uh there's a little bit of uncertainty i have some you know kinda financial uncertainties so um you know overall i'm not doing as good as i'd like to wow that's a good one <laughter> really happy um let me think about that a minute well actually um it wasn't that long ago actually i went to um <makes sound with mouth> okay i know that one actually i can come up with an answer um i helped out a lady she was at a at a tradeshow it was anaheim it was a natural products expo so it was pretty nice we uh we had some nice meals afterwards there was a lot of exhibiters giving out really nice samples it was in anaheim so i kinda got a chance to get away from l_a and um you know met some interesting people uh they were very outgoing they were willing to like have me experience their product or service and um i was around people that i work with who uh i got to socialize with so uh i think i was pretty happy back then and that was about uh about a month ago yeah yeah it was best friend i don't know if i really have a best friend but uh i would say um hmm i don't know technically i really don't have a best friend so it's really hard for me to answer that so uh i can't really come with an answer to be honest <laughter> um i i like to be conscientious i you know i do have flaws and every but i think overall i'm conscientious i try to be honest for the most part on the on the major issues i might you know say little white lies or you know i'm not perfect on that but when it comes to the serious stuff i tend to be pretty honest and i'm i'm a hard worker i got <g> got good work ethic um i tend to be pretty calm for the most part um what do i regret well can you elaborate that <laughter> uh well um i just well just overall um i regret uh not being a little more assertive in in my earlier uh earlier life um and kinda put myself in this position it's going kinda goes back to my financial decisions that was sort of that's sort of like my albatross in my life i made some bad decisions and unfortunately i have to kinda pay the price for now so i kind of like sort of like living sort of a pauper existence right now which is kinda kinda depressing so i would say that's probably what i regret most of all well i'd say to really you know analyze kinda go with what you really feel um i think i was going with other people's opinion other people's advice i was kinda going away from my basic beingness you know like the way i really felt like for example i'd make i would do aggressive uh investing which if it turned out good it would've been like sort of like winning the lotto i would've been well off for the rest of my life <laughter> but unfortunately it went the opposite way too too many eggs in that basket so i kinda regretted going with my gut feeling and and let other people influence me and uh 'cause by nature i'm a conservative person so i should really do more concervative investments in other areas my life i tend to be more conservative but i kinda made some aggressive financial <f> financial decisions so that's pretty much kinda it always goes back to that area as far as what i regret yeah wow that's interesting uh well i've been doing a lot on weekends so <laughter> <laughter> well i do like like to be profitable uh i like to do something where i can actually you know make money that's sort of like my bread and butter time 'cause i do tradeshows but if i'm not doing that then i like to maybe watch some um you know i'd like to go to entertainment maybe go to a ball game uh go to a movie go out with some friends so i would just or you know just kinda kick back but my main primary <prima> primary focus would be on you know earning earning money on the weekends uh that's interesting most proud of um i would say that i lived by and large i lived a wholesome life i would say i never got myself into any kind of really bad bad uh vice um you know i i lived a pretty wholesome <wholeso> wholesome life i'd say that'd probably i don't know if it's really proud um but as but as far as i stayed the course as far as uh not going down any real deep <laughter> alleys so to speak okay my pleasure bye now           
<sync> yes okay originally from texas oh few weeks ago uh well i've been living in um palm springs actually so uh l_a there's a lot more to do and uh weather's a lot better uh for work yes uh the weather the beach a lot of activities things to do mm traffic and the uh rental is higher <high> a lot higher here uh at at first it was a little difficult but then i adapted uh just in the united states uh new experiences uh learn a lot of things uh yeah one time i went uh yosemite and up through san francisco uh i really enjoy the beautiful scenery uh probably when i uh last year i i uh met a girlfriend up in uh san francisco and drove down highway one and uh saw a lot of uh sights hearst castle things like that uh computer science uh well i went to school back in the eighties and uh computers were uh kind of a new new up and coming thing so decided to to do that little bit not too much uh probably um i think to have like a little uh little magazine uh well i've started already started it it's like a small uh local magazine that has uh coupons and uh going to expand it to different uh parts of california probably shy um mm well let's see not uh i guess not as outgoing as many of my friends um actually i uh go dancing i like dancing it's relaxing to me uh uh uh i do latin dancing so i do it several times a week so last weekend i went very good um i i think i argued with someone a couple of weeks back it was about a religion religious issue um felt okay mm um see can't think of one right now <laughter> let's see maybe uh when i was doing one of my real estate sales um i was um sometimes the clients are pretty uh pretty difficult and i think i should've been like a little more uh assertive with them mm probably uh moving to california well i was uh leaving my friends and family in texas and um just pretty much starting a new life out in california out here uh well it was it was pretty difficult but you know i got adjusted well um i have only an aunt and a few cousins left so uh it's it's not too much a relationship i have a a a great a uh an aunt that's the sister of my mom and uh you know i send her texts periodically but uh most of the time i really don't have  much uh contact with family um probably parents both of them were very supportive mm probably when the parents were sick and passed away no uh well i both parents were um uh got sick and uh got dementia and uh it's you know one parent didn't remember who i was so it was uh that part was pretty difficult well they they passed away so it's just uh it's been about ten years so it's uh just um it's just memories now mm not too easy uh it's just tossing and turning i think all night and uh probably thinking thinking too much about things uh probably like the future things like the economy and uh my work things like that uh tired tired <laughter> mm just uh not as positive no no mm probably uh few weeks ago i received a pretty good uh real estate commission so i was happy about that uh when i'm in l_a um going to some of the meet up groups or some some of the uh i like going to whole foods and and trying some new uh places to go salsa dancing no mm probably to be more uh outgoing mm probably be more successful in uh business and be a little more uh uh outgoing mm probably my boss uh he's pretty uh condescending and um really likes to belittle people and uh <laughter> put him uh put himself as the king so he he has says a lot of comments to make himself build himself up and uh belittle whoever whoever else is in the room uh it's well usually when you go in uh he likes to brag on how much money he's made in the business and uh then say things like uh see see how much better i am than you are uh you've look how much money i've made this year and and you're the worst piece of shit agent there is things like that mhm um probably uh i have integrity and a good heart hardworking honest um probably i just went i guess uh some of the times i've gone dancing uh i went to a casino uh in a little town called temecula i met a lot of new friends and uh it uh dancing and meeting friends new friends um probably it was about it uh education i guess my education and uh able to uh move move out here where i wanted to go thank you bye 
<sync> yeah i'm okay burbank california yeah the weather of course i think everyone likes the weather um it's not too city like chicago or new york it's um it's big enough we have beaches we're not land locked woo sometimes the smog the traffic the fact that i've just been here like my entire life almost not enough as i'd like to i go to school in chicago and i've been to new york a couple times san francisco and i took a road trip across the country that was cool i saw a couple states seeing new places um going to landmarks that i've only read about or seen pictures of um i traveled from los angeles to chicago taking route sixty six and the best part was seeing the grand canyon for the first time it was the coolest thing i've ever seen probably <laughter> happy and then just happy it was it was beautiful it was nice i haven't felt like that in a long time i was studying film it's just something i've always loved for as long as i can remember and when it came time to start applying to schools i wasn't sure what i wanted to do and um i applied to northwestern as a film student and it just ended up being the right decision ooh <laughter> um i love making movies but part of me really loves making people laugh and being in front of the camera so uh comedian a comedic <comie> <laughter> comedic actor would be totally great but that's hard <laughter> i am super outgoing and i love talking to people a lot i like i like being the center of attention usually <laughter> i um i like to watch mindless television like um toddlers in tiaras and um duck dynasty just t_v programs where i really don't have to pay attention at all i'm okay at it i get really emotional really fast but i am usually able to to keep my anger down and not like lash out at others and stuff for the most part sometimes i get into like arguments and fights with my friends and people who are important to me really easily and i hate apologizing to people so the fights could last pretty long um my best friend <laughter> ryan i think and it was about our relationship and just how we kind of messed it up and crossed some lines and uh where how were gonna go back to the way it was before really hard it's um he's my best friend and i miss him but we messed up and it's just it's not the same it's like not the same friendship <laughter> me too <laughter> <laughter> too many um i guess scrubbed_entry when i had a boyfriend and he has a girlfriend which was not okay i wish i would've just realized that this was bad and just would've stopped there and not have let it continue for weeks which led to my break up and then our friendship being really messed up i guess not spend as much time with him as i did be more assertive um i guess it was in november i was very depressed and suicidal so i told my friend what i was feeling and that she needed to take me to the e_r and from the e_r i had the choice to i don't know i guess go home or get sent to a mental hospital and even though i felt like i didn't have a choice i knew it was my choice and i decided to go to the mental hospital which was like the worst experience of my life ever um <exhale> it was awful it was in chicago and um it was scary i mean i didn't know anyone and they just like take all your stuff and they put you in some scrubs and they just start giving you medication and you're basically left to your own devices there were only like three group therapy sessions a day and everyone there was mostly men and um they were all really old and it was scary i didn't know anyone everyone most of the people there weren't depressed they were violent <laughter> so that was pretty scary and i just um it was really hard for me <laughter> i had been so depressed for like a month i stopped going to my classes and work and i told my teachers lies about being sick and i just kept calling in sick to work i dropped a class and i was failing my classes and not turning in any work and i wasn't talking to any of my friends and i was drinking a lot and passing out and vomiting everywhere and i was just in a really bad place and when i finally was gonna kill myself i realized i needed help it was um i had severe depression when i was a younger teenager and i tried to kill myself then and i um got put in therapy for quite some time so i figured i don't want to go down that bad path again i just wanna get better so i had to do it i had to get help i do i go once a week i feel like if you have the right therapist it's really useful i had one therapist that i really liked and i thought we could've gone really far but sadly she's back in chicago and i'm in los angeles so i have to i have to make do with this new therapist and she's okay she's not we're not that great together but she's who i had right now it's better than nothing <laughter> not that easy at all um ever since <yawn> i got out of the hospital and start and i began medication for my depression i um just haven't been able to sleep well falling asleep is hard staying <laughter> asleep is hard have really crazy vivid dreams that wake me up and are disturbing um i guess just sometimes they reflect things that i'm worried about or happening in my life but they're just they're scary and they seem so real that sometimes i wake up and i have to ask my mom like did we go here did we do this did this really happen and it's usually no you dreamed that sometimes i've gotten so scared i like talk in my sleep and wake myself up probably <laughter> like two nights ago that is a hard question i think in november <yawn> after i got out of the hospital i finally had one good day and my friend took me into downtown chicago and we went to the sears tower and got to look over those like big windows that you walk out on and see the city and that was really cool <laughter> um probably super outgoing likes to be the center of attention funny and a little bit crazy i try not to regret things in my life oh um i would say that living is worth it and just don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it don't wait until it gets really bad um i guess my ideal weekend would be <laughter> sleeping in and then catching a movie with my friends maybe going home with them and bake some cookies <laughter> eat all the cookies watch some t_v have a sleep over and then like make pancakes in the morning and watch more movies we watch a lot of movies i would like to do that <laughter> in my free time go for a walk i don't know go to the beach <laughter> um that is a hard question i mean i think i've done a lot of great things in my life and um i have achieved a lot but i think one of the proudest things proudest moments in my life is something really small and insignificant i was doing this exercise boot camp and the last person to like cross the finish line had to do like thirty push ups and it was some guy i didn't really know him at all and the trainer said does anyone wanna help him if someone helps him you have to do half each and no one wanted to help him and i just decided to start doing push ups with him and i just it wasn't 'cause i wanted to get credit or because i thought it would make me look good i just did it and no one really knows about that but it just i feel really good about that it was nice it meet you <laughter> bye 
<synch> yes i'm good michigan two years ago um every three months it's more homey and country than fast-paced and stuff uh the i work in the entertainment business so i had to be out here it was pretty easy because i lived in new york first and if you can survive new york you can survive l_a the weather of course beaches uh the people are much ruder and mean than what i'm used to but i like l_a uh graphic design media arts um in high school i was ahead in all my classes and credits so i had to take a college course so while in high school i got a two year college degree doing it 'cause i was good at it yeah yeah but now i wanna go into something else um i'm in school actually i take online classes now for business management <laughter> i um a really one day i wanna own me and my sisters wanna own our own uh rental properties and like uh real estate company we own six houses now we bought with our college money and now we wanna eventually one day own our own homes and apartment complexes yeah meeting new people seeing different things that you've never seen before um different languages everything just seeing what the world has to offer oh okay um me and my sisters went to hawaii last year um i believe we went to hawaii <hawa> honolulu and to then hmm maui yeah and we met the people in hawaii and they were so nice if i could live there i would um everything was memorable but probably jet-skiing in honolulu was very fun yeah outgoing <laughter> <laughter> music music is much therapy for me um well my family is very musically inclined like my dad and my mom's family so music has always been like that thing no matter how i feel if i put music on it makes it much better i'm pretty good i used to box so it let out a lot of frustration so sometimes i do that too i go to the gym and i do like a kickboxing class but i don't i never escalated to the point where i like blurt out or no i can control it pretty much well i live with my sisters so i argue every day <laughter> but it was over clothes my sisters and clothes always clothes um my mother my father are pastors of a church i grew up with two sisters and a older brother who was a cop and we're pretty close i have a nephew we're pretty close like every day we see each other close and we don't all live in the same house but we're together every single day at some point when we lived in a when we lived in michigan my family eh is in michigan um when i cheat like right now i'm on a diet with my sisters but last night i snuck and got mcdonalds so i feel bad because they've been so sticking to it and i cheated but that's pretty much <laughter it <laughter> um hmm mm me and my when me and my a friend of mine got into it and we said things that weren't like we hit below the belt and we and we usually don't and we haven't spoken in like three months now and i know that it could've been prevented if we would've just sat down and talked to each other but it didn't make it that far so yeah um probably moving here moving to l_a because like i'm i'm really like close <clo> we're really close with our family like i skype with my mom and dad every day so it was hard to go from there to here and them taking care of everything to me and my sisters having to do it on our own it was much it was different oh my goodness uh my parents my brother my dad my mom my sisters my family <fam> i have a great family so my family definitely um i wanna say two years ago three years ago my brother was shot on duty and he almost lost his life but he didn't and for some reason as much as i try i don't tell them this 'cause i don't want them to be like i need to you know whatever i always think about it over and over again and i'll cry about it like it happened yesterday but it happened three years just the mere fact of almost losing him kinda yeah not easy i work as a personal assistant and administrative assistant for a casting agent so i'm on call for her whenever so i'm never i never get a good night's sleep ever i know <laughter> um a zombie <laughter> i'm pretty much you would never know 'cause when it's work i i'm professional so if i am tired they'd never know but i'm very annoyed and very grouchy when i haven't slept um <sigh> tired and i have crazy headaches but that's probably from not getting enough sleep and working too much but yeah very tired yeah definitely um i'm shorter with people like being in the industry i mean people don't really care it's all about self and when i first came here i had the i had the personality and attitude of family and love and nice and being here showed me that everybody's kinda out for self here even the like the other girls i work with so i've learned to like cut people off and be short with people when that's not really me but i just see that's how you have to be <laughter> no no um <sigh> last saturday i did a weigh-in and i lost seven pounds i was like excited so <laughter> that was the last time um care too much uh i think about others more than myself so she'd probably say i care too much i'm loving i'm the person that every friend i have confide in from best friend to just regular friend so yeah i'm the mom of my friends um no not no i don't regret anything hmm never take no for an answer um i wish i could well i don't know personally i wanna lose like twenty more pounds but uh just i don't know be a little more adventurous little more adventurous um <sigh> i don't think i've had a time baby feel bad no i can't no i don't think i have one it i'm sorry i don't think i <laughter> have one oh um well me and my sisters has just started with yoga and we already do the beach like every friday but yoga is like our new addiction so we do yoga and we probably go to like a spa or something that's an ideal <ide> yeah um my my job my career because i've gotten a pretty long way at twenty three the job i hold so i'm pretty pretty proud of that you're welcome bye 
<sync> sure i'm doing good how are you chicago yeah about twenty five years ago yeah it's been a while actually i haven't been back <laughter> i like l_a i like l_a mm it's a big city so it's kinda similar but the weather is not the same so gotta love l_a for the weather <tisk> family i was a child it took a little adjustment but not hard um the weather um i can't think of anything right off the bat but i sure wouldn't wanna leave so my family is here so that's another reason why i wouldn't wanna leave traffic <laughter> not really but i've traveled <tra> traveled a little bit yeah seeing new places different people the way they live their lives <tisk> um i went to monterey california earlier last <la> or the middle of last year that was very nice um it's a good question i'm not really sure uh there's probably i can't think of anything right off the bat which makes me think uh it's kinda weird but <laughter> astronomy yeah it was <tisk> i don't know just kinda fell into it took a course liked it and then took some more and kinda just went down that path no there's not much job opportunities so it's kinda limited yeah it does <laughter> um my dream job i would like to own a restaurant a nice a bar restaurant well i'd like to have something a little more upscale than most places you go to or at least in the area that i live in most places don't seem very kind of just seem like a dive bar just kind of worn out run down so something nice something different something creative something vibrant something for you know attracts a crowd but it's probably costly so i don't know if it's really plausible <laughter> i'm definitely more shy but i can be outgoing when i'm comfortable with people but initially i'm pretty shy <laughter> good idea um a lot of times i try to just lay back and you know do some deep breathing just kind of clear your mind or maybe just watch a movie listening to music is good reading a book kinda just takes your mind away relax i've gotten much better at it <laughter> i used to have problems with that when i was younger but i'm i'm good i'm good with that now learned that you shouldn't react immediately to situations you should you know think before you speak that type of thing um my ex girlfriend when we broke up about three months ago <laughter> um we're relationship just wasn't doing very well so it just kind of was going down a predictable path and we just were arguing over the same old stuff and wasn't really it wasn't a memorable argument but it was it was an argument so that's all i can think of and i haven't really seen her since so i don't know that's what it is nothing special just a typical argument between two people who had grown separate frustrated like yeah i guess everybody kinda sees things in their own way and you know my way and my perspective is right and i'm sure her way was right too so trying to convince somebody that you know of your ideas or what you're thinking is more difficult than it is because everybody's kinda looking out for themselves <tisk> but yeah mm that's a good example right there with the my girlfriend i didn't have to i could've reacted a little differently and not shown so much emotion um there's been times in my life where i've gotten into arguments with friends or something like that where you know or previous relationships where i probably shouldn't have reacted the way i did you know not that i did anything bad but just more of uh you know be more mature about it and not you know reveal your emotions so much or that type of thing <tisk> um <sigh> leaving my first girlfriend to go to school when i was eighteen this was a long time ago i went to school in san diego and i immediately wanted to come back so i kind of ruined our relationship and we're still friends and i wish i didn't do that mm i feel like i can contribute more to my family and my friends i i think i could do better i i think i sell myself short so employment opportunities are hard to come by but if i could find a good job i'd be a lot more happy because i could provide for myself and others so not be so much of a burden to people around me <tisk> yeah real difficult <laughter> it's good it's very good we're pretty open with each other and i see my mom and dad and my sister quite often so it's a good relationship i mean we we get along well could be i mean it's not it's not perfect but it's good <tisk> pretty easy i'm a good sleeper um probably irritable there's it's harder to do tasks it's kind of like you feel like you're being strange or something because you don't have as much energy and good relatively well spring time always makes everybody feel well no not at all never <tisk> um really really i mean we all feel happy every day at some point but really happy <sigh> it's probably been a while um probably like superbowl sunday i was with all my friends we were having a good time so it's been probably like a month and a half or something when i was really really happy i wish i was more i guess stuck to my goals and i wish i had better drive to succeed i don't know i usually settle for less so i don't know i i guess that's the calm demeanor part of me that's good and bad <laughter> don't really matter i kinda live in the moment and then you kinda realize that five ten years have gone by and you should've done something um i'm just gonna stick to that argument with my girlfriend <laughter> three months ago she made me feel pretty bad <laughter> um i i don't know uh when i was when i was in high school i got into an argument with a friend and i drove my car too fast and it was an area that i didn't know and i hit a turn that i didn't know was coming and i crashed my car so i wish i didn't do that but that's a long time ago so it's not a big deal now <laughter> stupid <laughter> immature <laughter> <tisk> um my parents some of my close friends i have i have a good group of three or four friends that've been positive influences yeah mm a caring guy nice person good heart a little a little unmotivated needs to improve on certain aspects of his life to make himself better and uh passionate i guess passionate in a good and bad way <laughter> <laughter> well i care a lot and at the same time sometimes it gets the best of me mm <tisk> sometimes you feel like you know you're doing more for your friends or somebody like that you're doing more than they deserve and you're not it's not being reciprocated so that's an example yeah probably but i can't think of anything off the top of my head <tisk> um focus more on school because while you're young you have the ability to multitask and scrubbed_entry mm <tisk> i don't know really enjoyed i mean i do things everyday that i enjoy but really enjoyed i don't i don't know um i i i cleaned up a bunch of stuff from my room so it was nice to shed some old garbage so that that was alright but i don't know if i really enjoyed that but i felt content after it mm <tisk> not much it's i mean it's kinda sad i don't know uh <laughter> i think i could do better i feel like i'm an underachiever so not much i don't know i'm very detail oriented organized i like to finish tasks um i care a lot you know i'm very caring um i have good intentions in mind i don't like to wrong people i don't like to lie because once you lie one lie leads to another so i don't like that but yeah that's that's about it <laughter> cool right on have a good day 
<sync> yes i'm good thank you um i was born in mexico city yes um about thirty four years ago yeah <laughter> um i try to go back once a year but i haven't been in about three years um i haven't had the time and i've traveled to other places but i'm planning on going back probably next year um well i can't ever see myself moving back to mexico city it's a huge huge city and i like l_a more there's more opportunities and i just feel at home here my family moved here um i like i said <s> i was very young and my parents moved um to california to work and then we just stayed here um i love traveling i have not traveled as much as i would like to um but i do love to travel um just seeing new things meeting people from other countries just um feeling relaxed and having no worries because you're on vacation um i just love being  in other places um the last trip i took was a seven day cruise and it went to saint thomas barbados saint lucia um saint martin and it was amazing i would love to do that trip again um i think <sigh> going to mexico the last time i was there i went to the pyramids teotihuacan and i had not been there in many years and it just was amazing to see the pyramids and i can't even imagine how they were able to build such great um structures uh i consider myself more shy um in social situations i kind of feel uncomfortable um i'm not one to just go up to people and start conversations um if people come up to me of course i'll talk to them but i feel slightly awkward just kind of out of place at a party um i actually studied history <laughter> um i've always been interested in history and i just wanted to learn about histories from other cultures and of course u_s history so i'm very into uh history um i'm actually working in uh the education field my dream job would actually be um traveling around the world and having a show on like the travel channel <laughter> that would be my dream job because i would get paid to travel and it's something i enjoy to do doing um so i would love to do that as a job <laughter> <laughter> um i love reading and i love taking baths so to relax i like to take a bath and i read while i'm in the bath and um i also like going to the gym that helps me uh deal with stress and it actually relaxes me even though i'm exercising um i used to be not very good at controlling it when i was a kid i would get mad um very easily and sometimes as an adult i still get angry easily but i've gotten a lot better at trying to think about things first before saying them and not having outbursts things like that um the last time i argued with somebody was probably about a week ago it was um my best friend and she actually she has kids i don't and for some reason she thought or thinks that i think i'm a better person than she is and because i went to school and she didn't and she's home with kids and you know i'm able to do more things um i don't think i've ever made her feel that i i and i definitely know i don't feel like i'm better than her but for some reason she accused me of that and we had an argument about it um well that situation i wish i had handled differently um because when she was talking to me she was very upset and i started off pretty calm just trying to reason with her and let her know that i certaintly didn't feel like i was better than her but towards the end of the conversation it just kinda turned into a yelling match between the two of us and i wish i had been able to just stay calm and maybe asked her to call me later once we calmed down instead of just continuing the argument um i was angry at first but once we hung up i felt really bad about the situation i felt that maybe i could've just let her let out all her feelings and then try to speak to her calmly um instead of yelling at her too oh wow um that's a tough one i think um gosh i think one of the toughest <tough> hardest decisions i've had to make is breaking up with a boyfriend of seven years um although i knew that it was the right thing to do i was kind of hanging on to the fact that we had been together for so many years and i kinda felt by ending the relationship um i would've wasted those last seven years of my life it was a pretty tough decision to make but i realized that it was the best decision for me at the time and i'm actually glad i did because then i went on to meet um my husband <laughter> thank you um well about i would say maybe fifteen years ago i was hanging out with a couple of friends at a club and they met some guys and um they invited us back to their place and i really didn't wanna go because i didn't know these people and i mean i knew their names and that's about it but my friends really wanted to go and i wasn't the one driving so i decided to just go along with them and back at their house um one of the guys actually pulled me into a room and tried i i got scared i yelled he tried to choke me and i thought i was gonna die right right there i thought he was gonna kill me but luckily one of my friends knocked on the door because she heard me scream and we left so it could've been a worse situation but i still think about it and wish that i could erase it from my mind it was um we have a pretty good relationship i am close to i have a sister and a brother um my sister is two years younger and my brother is two years older and we get along pretty well um my sister and i used to be best friends but then we grew apart and then um now we're actually closer i think than ever and i have a pretty good relationship with my parents um my dad still treats me like i'm a little kid sometimes <laughter> which annoys me but i think we have a pretty good solid relationship yeah um <sigh> i usually wake up a few times throughout the night um so i think it's rare for me to sleep uh the whole night through ever um and i do feel a little like tired in the morning when i wake up it's hard i'm not a morning person definitely um so yeah it's kinda hard to get a good night's sleep um i don't know it i have a hard time falling asleep and then sometimes i have bad dreams or i need to get up to use the restroom um but yeah it i don't remember the last time i actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once um emotionally good um i'm actually on vacation right now from work so that's really nice um physically i feel good i haven't been to the gym in a while so that kinda makes me feel bad um 'cause i like working out um but health wise i'm good <laughter> no no um it was last <la> this past weekend i actually went out of town with my husband we didn't go very far we went to santa barbara but we really enjoyed ourselves um we went wine tasting and went to the beach and just had a really good time um she would probably describe me as a good caring person um patient very shy um she'd probably say too that i have a hard time saying no to people when they ask me for favors 'cause i'm always doing things for other people um so yeah that's how i think she would describe me i wish i was more outgoing um i wish that i what else definitely more outgoing um so i could have more friends i don't have a large group of friends because i am very shy um i also wish that i could have more patience than i do <laughter> sometimes i'm very short of patience and um i wish i could find a better job so i could do more traveling um yes i actually took a really long time after high school to go back to school and get my degree and i really wish that i could've you know taken care of it a lot sooner than i did um and i also regret spending seven years of my life with my ex boyfriend um i would've told myself to stay focused on school that going out and hanging out and just you know and going to parties um was not as important as i thought it was and that my education should always come first um i'm proud that after so many years of not being in school i was able to go to u_c_l_a and get my degree um yeah that would be my proudest achievement <laughter> okay thank you bye 
<sync> yes i'm doing well los angeles the greater los angeles area people diversity and various entertainment and activities um fickle weather traffic and litter i have traveled domestically not internationally seeing other places and how people live and the culture the last trip that i went to was san diego but uh from childhood or as an adult um family vacations to um baja and rosarito beach yeah the reason why that memory comes to mind because um this weekend is easter and we usually will go down to easter <east> easter spring break to rosarito baja um i have a bachelor's <b> bachelor's in communication studies because it's a open field just doesn't deal with um communication interactively but performing arts telecommunications business entrepreneurship so no i'm not i'm actually unemployed um i think to own my business that's my dream my dream job to have my own company um i would like to open something in like the telecommunications area as a business something do online online services um i like to make things with my hands so my next venture would would be to create all natural soy candles something in that area um a mixture a mixture of shy and outgoing because i have to observe people and crowds and that's how i usually make a determination if i remain reserved or remain open i listen to like a meditation tape or i take a walk or go get a massage fair oh man <laughter> uh probably yesterday or this morning um usually the argument is about me making myself clear or me repeating myself twice no it usually gets the other person in trouble mm i redeemed a service from a mechanic who fixed my transmission and i had a warranty and i wrote to the department of consumer affairs and the guy offered me a portion of the settlement agreement and i decided to take him to small claims court to get a bigger amount and i wish i would've have taken the offer that he gave me at the midst of dealing with the third party which was the department of consumer affairs and because of that i took him to small claims court and i end up losing the whole settlement and only been offered a very small portion so i wish i would've taken the higher road than taken the lower road i don't tend to feel guilty about too many things hardest decision uh i don't know financially emotionally mm emotionally letting go a past relationship it's the hardest thing that i i won't say the hardest thing but it was a difficult thing yes it was a relationship of seven years but um that person has already moved on so uh they want me to be in their life in hopes that if something goes wrong with my current relationship we'll always have something to fall back on uh yeah it is hard um an event something i could erase from my memory um i don't know <laughter> there's a lot of events that i just automatically erase from my memory but whatever comes to mind right um probably the death of a relative um alone and misinformed because i didn't know that they were that sick and i didn't know that they were um their days were numbered and i could've had more opportunity to spend time with them and make better a better connection in the last days um it's fair to midland mm my immediate i'm very close but distant not very close my mother um yes uh she's encouraged me to continue my education to always fall back on my hobbies hopes goals and dreams she always encourages me to always stay aloof and out there looking for a better opportunity and she encourages me to not be afraid to explore other ventures easy <laughter> easy <laughter> i've been feeling well um yes a little stressed but i'm trying to manage that i leave the stressful environment um in the past about three years ago um because i was having issues in my learning environment and um i feeling <f> i was feeling emotionally attacked yeah i was having uh a issue with a professor who was just very i don't know a a very different personality and he almost ran me down the crosswalk at school i felt i felt um like i was in a a dishonest environment i felt like i wanted to get you know switch his class and get into another class but i had no choice but to stay in there and deal with his meanness for the whole semester um i think through finding p_t_s_d they were trying to link depression no financially i'm not capable and i haven't found a counselor who is willing and committed to working with me and helping me with my issues i find that a lot of counselors they listen to me and then they laugh at me and then they tell me the opposite of what's what i'm telling them mhm mm last time i felt really happy i really don't know that's a good question um just just did what i want i just relaxed i just relaxed and i you know i don't know <laughter> i don't have any best friends my best qualities that i'm uh hard working i'm reliable i'm a excellent friend um i'm energetic and i'm a go getter things that i wish i could change about myself probably be less sensitive don't take things so personally and um learn how to help myself before helping others no i don't have any regrets in my life um if i could've do things differently ten years ago i probably would've focused and studied more and less being out of the house and hanging with friends mm that i got have a a college education and i'm self sufficient and i can pay my bills by myself <laughter> and i'm alive goodbye 
<synch> yes i'm okay i'm feeling a little tired and uh worried um well i'm looking for a place to live and um i don't have a job right now so things are <sigh> things are a little shaky for me i'm staying with my son in venice uh it's pretty good but uh both of us need to have our own space so that's why i'm looking for another place to live originally from new york but i've been in california since the early seventies so yeah uh i moved to l_a because i had been living in portland oregon and i was getting tired of the weather up there and my son was down here so it seemed like a good place to be um it wasn't too hard i uh i met people right away and um i just really like it here so it was uh it was easy to connect with people the weather is <laughter> number one like for most people i love being near the ocean um i like the energy i like the um i like the artistic culture mhm uh well everybody loves the traffic i mean loves the weather and hates the traffic so i kinda feel <fee> i feel the same way um sometimes it it gets a little wearing that it's so busy and the fact that it's so expensive makes it difficult uh no not as much as i'd like if if i had more funds <fu> more income more funds i would travel more um <sigh> well mostly i've been um xxx i traveled let's see so my longest uh trip that was out of the country was to mexico and i traveled drove down with a friend uh down to oaxaca and the whole trip we took about mm i think we took us about four weeks going down and back from uh the bay area um yeah that was a fun trip well uh we'd been working together on the census and she had made that trip a few times and invited me to come along with her um from that trip i would say we were in oaxaca for day of the dead so it was uh celebrating day of the dead with the family in the little village that we were staying in and everybody in the village makes an altar in their house uh for their uh loved ones who have passed away and um they also decorate clean and decorate the graves so there were lots of flowers and it was just it was neat to be there and be with that family celebrating that uh well i studied <studi> i was in the liberal liberal arts program but i didn't stay <st> i stayed only stayed in school for uh in college for a couple of years um but i was most interested in liberal arts and the humanities huh my dream job would be uh personal assisting somebody who was in a creative field and getting to uh travel and go to events with them uh it's hard to break into um i i'm starting now very uh minimally with somebody who i'm doing more of a volunteer work with and i'm i'm working on building up some of my skills so that i can be doing more of that i'm fairly i'm kind of a friendly introvert so um i i'm you know i have no trouble meeting people uh i don't hold back and um you know xxx just i'm not shy <sh> like shy at parties i'll go up and talk to people um but i i am overall kind of introverted so um i prefer one-on-one than big groups um i like to watch uh well i <laughter> i like to watch uh improvement shows like on uh h_g_t_v i like to watch um like remodel shows and and see transformations or or watch movies or read oh and and i play some solitaire on my uh my kindle fire um i don't usually realize i'm mad until later <laughter> so <laughter> it doesn't really come up um and i i just tend not to have the kind of life where um those situations arise uh sometimes you know sometimes on the road um i get a little annoyed uh i don't get annoyed so much at like when people cut me off or anything like that um but when people are deliberately rude and and you know honk for no reason or um you know when they get angry because maybe i've done something inadvertent you know cut them off by mistake and they <the> you know like they get really angry then that makes me angry in return hmm <sigh> um yeah like i said i don't really get into arguments um i did have <ha> i was with a friend the other day and um she got annoyed with me because she felt like i was correcting her so it wasn't really an argument but she you know i had said something that she heard as a correction well it was a correction and she got angry um but um well then i felt criticized and i felt i felt vulnerable eh i wasn't it was it was pretty uncomfortable hmm um well i in that situation i didn't i didn't have to correct her um so <sigh> i think that's something i'm starting to look at in myself is my need to be right so in general that's i'm trying to to catch that and just let people make mistakes without <laughter> without my telling them about it mm hmm boy i don't know um gee that's tough i can't i don't know that i've had that much trouble making decisions um hmm well uh <u> uh was hard for me to decide to uh put my cat to sleep when he was sick oh it was <wa> and i had to give up a cat um when i was moving once and and that was difficult too 'cause um <sigh> well in the case of the first cat the one who was sick um i decided when the vet said that he thought it was the humane decision um and with the cat i had to give up i didn't i didn't really decide um i was moving to a place that where i couldn't take her and so i i found somebody who could take her hmm <sigh> mm see um gee that's tough <sigh> if i don't really eh the the erasing from the memory part um there's nothing i really wish i could erase from my memory um trying to think of something that i've done that i wish i hadn't done um oh okay i remember something there was <wa> <laughter> there was a time when i was i was in a class at junior college it was a film class and uh i was i was the one who was um after we we went out and did a little film project um and we're supposed to bring it back into class the next week uh i was the one who had the film and through different just things that were happening in my life right now i never went back to the school but i never brought them the film back so all the work they had done um they had to do over again and i still feel bad about that eh it's pretty easy um sometimes i wake up in the early morning hours and and have trouble going back to sleep but that's not very often i've been feeling kind of tired and low level depressed and like not feeling a lot of options no yes i have uh well there were two times there was once um back in like nineteen seventy two nineteen <ninetee> yeah about nine nineteen seventy two or three and then um another time um oh so then when would that've been about sixteen years ago um just feeling like there wasn't um you know feeling that feeling that things weren't gonna change if i didn't get some help and that if i i didn't have to you know that maybe if some <s> i got some medication that would help me um in the short term so i'm not going to therapy right now uh i was moving around a lot finances i wasn't really feeling the need um i'm starting to think it might be a an option again i feel like therapy can be useful yes well when i went to therapy um it was helpful to have somebody who listened and could also offer impartial suggestions for helping me to improve the way i was feeling <deep breath> um <sigh> well i was on the beach last weekend uh it was a beautiful day and i was sitting in the sun and uh just relaxing and i had my notebook and i was doing some writing and i felt very happy and content uh i'm kind and compassionate and i'm a good listener and i'm intelligent and i have uh i have good ideas um <sigh> well i wish that uh sometimes i wish i was <wa> i was a harder worker um i'm not really willing to take low wage jobs even though i i need work so i just don't feel like i'm willing to do anything um and um i wish i could act i i said i had good ideas that um i have good ideas and i'm good at the uh the onset but i'm not really good on the follow-through so a lot of those ideas get started but then i don't take them the distance that's probably the the thing i'd like to change about myself the most uh ten or twenty years ago i'd give myself the advice to go back to school and get my degree finish my education um and be willing to um to work a regular job and to um to start putting money away for my uh retirement um proud of uh my children and i'm proud of the friendships i have and i'm proud that um eh that people eh people do eh admire me um and value my opinion goodbye 
<sync. yes i'm alright south l_a um the weather the women the opportunities that's about it racism police brutality injustice that's it mm no not much of a exploring type of person um psychology mhm um it was one of the classes i excelled in the most so i decided to change it from business to psychology yeah yes no to own my own record label um it it's moderately hard but you know take it one day at a time just i guess you know stay focused a little bit of both um i tend to be shy in um situations i'm not comfortable with or i'm new to and i'm outgoing in places i'm more comfortable with yeah <laughter> um turn the lights down low and listen to soft music mhm i'm getting better over the years um i think i'm pretty decent now compared to how i used to be yes ma'am um due to the lack of i guess you could say controlling my emotions i have uh gotten incarcerated sent to prison yeah mm i'm not sure uh i don't really have a recollection of my hardest decision i've made in my life um it was probably a few days ago with the girl i was talking to and i was arguing about her lack of communication and attentiveness yeah uh frustrated because um you know uh you you put in a certain amount of effort and you expect you know the same effort by the other person when you're in a relationship and at the same time when you when you have expectations sometimes you kinda set yourself up for failure so you know i guess i'm just learning there's a lot of situations i would've handled differently um probably the most recent was uh i had gotten into a physical <phy> a physical altercation with an inmate when i was incarcerated and that made me that's what sent me to prison and and i had to do a lot more time and um if i handled it differently i probably would've never went to prison i probably would've been home a lot sooner than i originally happen yeah mm there are several events i wish i could erase from my memory um probably uh my first girlfriend um she did something really uh extreme it wasn't necessary in my eyes and it and it cost <co> it could've cost me my life i think that that that's a recurring thought that i i wish i could completely erase from my memory along with the good memories as well um a few you few fights uh i guess you could say shoot outs um getting jumped getting robbed you know those things i think those inhibit me i guess to to explore certain areas of life that i'm not comfortable with so those are the feww things that it'd be nice if i could erase it completely yeah <sigh> hurting people that didn't need to be hurt emotionally especially um a few women in my life or in my past um probably putting my mother through certain things that she didn't have to go through along with my close friends and family as well um used to be rocky growing up but as i got older and matured and the certain experiences that i've been through kind of brought me closer to my family so now it's it it's pretty decent it's it's pretty decent mm i would say my mother um yeah my mother um well she she uh she had her share of experiences negative and positive um i admire her the struggles she's been through um she she she uh experienced difficult economic hardships growing up but that didn't stop her um from raising a son at a young age finishing school getting her master's and just just overall being a a good person and she also battled mental health issues as well and um probably not the best of family that she could've been raised with so she so she's kinda of like a a inspiration to to me and other people as well so i would say my mother mm it's not easy so yeah it's not easy i couldn't tell you i i i've always had sleeping issues um i usually just take uh like over the counter sleep medication or nyquil but it makes you drowsy the next morning so it's like it's a negative effect really yeah the medication <medi> i don't know shit i don't know but i just stopped taking it 'cause i didn't like feeling drowsy not good at all um yeah i mean i recently got released from prison not too long ago uh i'm older now and a lot more responsibilities and i feel like my life is not where it's supposed to be i feel like i could've made a lot more better decisions in my life you know sometimes feeling sorry for myself and just things that i've been through and the whole nine yards so yeah it's all good yeah so true yes <sniffle> about two and a half three years ago <deep breath> <sigh> myself i um i was i was just tired of not i don't know i guess school kind of made me seek help because i started to understand myself how my brain works um you know so i decided to seek help maybe to better my life yeah you could say that yes i am yes yes i do actually i do mm better decision making um better tools to reflect on choices um how to control uh certain situations better yeah um <sniffle> well instead of just always reacting on emotion no matter what kind of emotion it is i step back and and and i assess the situation you know to see what's what's the best way to to react towards the situation and by doing that it has made me more mature emotionally more mature and just has a positive outcome <laughter> um i was lying next to a beautiful woman who who cared about me and the feeling was mutual so that was probably the most happy oh my goodness spontaneous um outgoing sometimes a little crazy um fun that's about it nothing um like i said earlier just you know hurting the the few women that were in my life my past and my friends and family that's about it oh shit uh school is really important um how i carry myself the people who i surround myself with and what i choose to do in my free time those are the few things i would tell myself good music um a good game of basketball um sex um i like going out i like going to parties um social gatherings where everyone's friendly and and there's no drama that's what i like dancing beautiful women a couple drinks that's about it um i guess not not necessarily giving up and and um just just i don't know just keep going just just not giving up really yeah mhm bye bye 
<sync> yeah sure i'm good how are you i'm from florida originally mhm where are you from oh um for work <laughter> uh i haven't been back in like a few months um i don't know i guess it's like a smaller town than here it was pretty easy it's um it's not that  much of a difference except i guess the buildings are bigger <laughter> um <tisk> i like the weather and uh i like the environment of like hollywood i guess <laughter> i hate the transportation <transporta> the transportation system and the traffic it's really bad <laughter> mhm yeah i've traveled a lot around america um i like like seeing new places and meeting new people from different areas and stuff and uh i guess it's just relaxing and it's fun <laughter> uh well i went to canada once my mom has a friend up there so we went to visit her there it's pretty cold <laughter> i didn't like that about that particular trip or um i don't know she made us this uh like canadian food called i think it's poutine or something and so i guess that <laughter> that was a  new experience um i try to get out in the sun like go to the beach or something or read a book um pretty okay <laughter> depends on how bad the situation is um i don't know like  two days ago i was arguing with my sister about something oh yeah <laughter> i really don't remember it something stupid i think she i don't know she borrowed something from me and she didn't give it back on time <laughter> um i don't know i guess i mean yeah i wish i just wouldn't lose my temper so quickly sometimes but that doesn't happen really often um i don't know i guess think more before i talk then maybe i won't lose my temper <laughter> um something i wish i could erase from my memory um i don't know i guess just like uh negative people or something negative people that i've met before i guess i just wanna erase the thought of meeting them um well i had like friends that were just like not very good company and they're just very not very good influences so yeah i would just wanna erase meeting them but i'm not friends with them anymore so um my who's a positive influence my family is a positive influence <laughter> and my friends now oh it's pretty good i talk to them a lot i see them a lot so yeah mm the hardest decision i've ever had to make i don't know <laughter> i guess um what i wanted to study in college maybe it's not that hard but <laughter> it's a little it's a big decision computer science thanks yeah a little bit <laughter> not not as much but a little bit well i got into it it when <wh> i got into it when i was a teenager so i guess i just and i was good at it so i just figured i'd go on studying it for higher at a higher level yeah somewhat but i uh kinda wanted to i was kinda trying to make a decision between that and like the arts so yeah i'm just happy i did it though my dream job <laughter> uh fashion designer <laughter> yeah how hard is the job um i don't think it's a hard job <laughter> i like clothes and fabric and making clothes like that so i don't think it's a hard job actually i fall asleep like within five minutes depending on how tired i am i'm very irritable <laughter> and uh yeah i'm very irritable and not good to be around <laughter> when i'm tired and i can't focus i've been feeling good fine thanks no no no um the last time i felt really happy mm i guess like a week or so ago i went to um i went to where did i go i went to this event downtown it was like a art walk thing so it was exciting thanks oh it was just like different art um galleries and stuff downtown they're just exhibiting their work and i don't know it was just interesting to walk around and see all that um i think i'm generous um patient i think i'm a good friend <laughter> um i think i'm hard working and what else yeah i that's that's it i think um i wish i was more outgoing like more sociable person and um what else i don't know and i wish i was like i guess not um not easy to um anger like get a temper or something oh no not in trouble it's just sometimes it's <laughter> it's not pleasant for people um getting <get> getting a having a temper but i've never gotten in trouble or mm really badly no um i can't <laughter> think of um i guess i was in i was in a um <tisk> elevator one time and this person like was running towards it and like like i was trying to hold it for them but i couldn't reach it in time and they like started cursing me out <laughter> so  like i felt really bad 'cause they  probably thought i didn't try to open it for them but yeah it was that <laughter> um anything i regret <clears throat> not really i well yeah i regret um not contacting like old friends that i knew so i guess yeah maybe i'll do that in the future i know them from like elementary school yeah but we lost contact through the years 'cause i switched schools <clears throat> for now i mean oh okay um i don't know i guess i would just say um learn as much as i can and i don't know just don't hold back so much with like um like not being outgoing and stuff i guess i'd just tell myself to be more outgoing <laughter> um i think they'd say the same thing i said earlier that i'm generous patient hard working and what else did i say um kind <laughter> i hope they'd say that <sigh> mm i am proud of my intelligence okay okay bye take care 
<synch> <laughter> yeah i'm good how are you i'm from here <he> um from los angeles <clears throat> probably the downtown the view and it's not that i like it but that's just where i for my parents were so that's where i grew up nothing that's where i live i i love l_a <laughter> maybe that it's ghetto but that's about it <laughter> <clears throat> i was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic hmm but i'm not sure <clears throat> 'cause <cau> 'cause my dad um he used to do that mm i'm not even sure to be honest haven't really thought about it i can't look at your shoes uh no i don't travel like that i don't know maybe money <m> money issue or something if i had money yeah i'll go all all over the world just <laughter> probably um outgoing depends i guess i don't know <laughter> about what shy or outgoing <clears throat> well outgoing you could be outgoing at a party you know like you're already out there so you can't be shy i guess if you're going to a party good probably um my girlfriend and 'cause i missed work 'cause i just felt lazy i was like whatever you know i just didn't wanna go and i i do what i want <laughter> i just didn't go nah not really she's over it already as long as we have the bills and rent paid <laughter> don't worry guilty probably nothing i guess i should've gone to work <laughter> mm <clears throat> damn that i could erase from that probably bad friends that i've met you know like friends that trick you you know that said that that they just trick you friends that deceive you i guess okay like um my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place so he told me to to he's gonna get me hired there and give me direct deposit but then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account so <laughter> <clears throat> probably moving out and into my mom's house yeah i haven't really been around eh like a big decision like that i wanted my own space you know my own life i wanna do what i want and come home when i want leave when i want yeah <laughter> yeah <laughter> uh we're all close we're all you know we hardly argue we're all always around we always see each other my mom my dad my brother <laughter> how they were a positive in my life well they're always there for you you know whether you have financial problems they're there they help you out whether you're sad they know you know and they'd be like hey what's wrong you know let's go out and eat somewhere just to cheer you up they're xxx they're your family and they're always there to motivate you and keep you going <sigh> uh easy actually yeah pretty easy i'm sorry um i haven't noticed but maybe probably the same you know i don't think sleep does affect you but i don't know maybe more tired but i don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that good everything's great um maybe that i wanna start <s> know like start a new business or something <clears throat> well like my dad um he wasn't around for a while but he just got back and um he actually opened up a shop and he's getting a a a lot of customers so i see that his business is growing so i'm probably gonna learn learn <lear> um learn mechanic like like i was saying earlier at school <clears throat> i don't even know what it what is that no nope <coughs> <coughs> i'm sorry um yesterday <laughter> last night 'cause i got a new game <laughter> <coughs> that i'm funny <laughter> i uh uh no <coughs> um i don't think nothing everything's fine you know thank god everything's good right now i don't think there's nothing to change like that maybe a better job well first of all i don't even have a job so i guess to change i get a job nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that <clears throat> xxx could say probably that i'm responsible as well at home resting and then i call some friends over they usually do come over barbecue whatever comes to mind you know just there in my house 'cause i have a nice backyard 'cause i just moved to this new house so so far each xxx yeah so each weekend right now we just people come over family come over and we pretty pretty much just barbecue there just hang out <clears throat> my sister's birthday party it was on saturday and it was fun there was a lot of dancing you know people uh i saw family that i haven't seen for a while so i enjoyed doing that so <clears throat> probably that i was like i was able to help my mom throughout because she was going through a really hard time my mom and um for almost nine years 'cause she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent so i i'm proud that i was able to help her even though i could only give so little but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed and um being around my family music music always puts me in a good mood any kinda music even if it's even if it's depressing music it's still gonna <go> it it's still gonna get me happy yeah <laughter> mhm no problem anytime bye mm am i supposed to press the button <laughter> you say yeah <laughter> 
<synch> i'm good yes i'm good iowa when or why uh two thousand one mm holidays and special family events uh it's much better there scrubbed_entry and i uh got into u_c_l_a went to u_c_l_a for three years in their screenwriting program mhm <sniffle> it's took a long time it was difficult mm just the uh the stress <st> getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living you know mm variety there's a lot of variety <vari> there's a lot of variety here i like that <scoff> the obvious traffic <laughter> uh internationally no uh <sigh> just haven't had reason to i guess i have a b_s in math and physics um <sigh> i went to school later in life and i wanted to actually know something so um it was very difficult  very difficult but i did it mm why um it fascinated me i didn't wanna be intimidated by it oh yeah oh yeah <laughter> um to be employed writer extremely difficult extremely difficult writing any type of fictional fiction writing's extremely difficult if i worked then <th> as hard as i do now when i was in school i'd have a p_h_d in math and physics <sigh> it's so hard outgoing it depends on the circumstance it's it's not a catch-all depends on the the moment what do i do to relax i swim mhm swam when last time i swam um last friday yeah mm last friday what do i do when i am annoyed mm swear to myself pretty good mm pretty good takes takes a lot to get me to express anger but i do it was in traffic actually <laughter> so probably two weeks ago so in traffic sure um scrubbed_entry um just waiting for the light <l> light and some guy in a pickup is honking at me i'm like so i honk back and so he didn't like that and he pulled up along side me i had have no idea what his problem was and um we had a little <li> few words yeah i mean i i have no idea what i was doing wrong just waiting for the light guilty that's a strong word <sigh> don't know if i feel guilty as i feel remorseful about actions or words said and done in the past they come up oh just past interpersonal <inter> you know interpersonal reactions with friends or family you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you and i'm like oh why'd i say that why'd i do that <deep breath> mm <sigh> a situation xxx <sigh> uh woo drawing a blank um for me that question has a negative connotation so something that's possibly negative in my recent past um <sigh> what would i have done differently i've i don't i'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond and when and knowing not to respond um so nothing really springs  to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently oh swallowing my pride putting my tail between my legs and saying i was wrong to friends sure scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry i contacted him again and then we're fast friends again mhm <sigh> <sigh> you know this is again this is past past so not recent past so um probably altercations that i've had with my uh mom you know things i've said to hurt her you know you know when you hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks so any time any one of those situations you know so when i'm i think my emotional i_q has grown so i think in the past past my emotional i_q was very was stuck on infant <laughter> so so i have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families um my father never had a good relationship don't know if that will be possible he's still alive but he's in advanced alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody right now oh it's fine you know it was slow so someone oh um scrubbed_entry has been positive influence in my life um my sisters i talk with my sisters so extremely easy i sleep well each night about <abo> anywhere from at least eight to ten hours a night <laughter> yeah oh lethargic um <sigh> just going through the motions <laughter> you know um it's like this i'll frame it like this david lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some crazy stuff as far as movies and t_v's concerned he said the idea of the angst-driven artist is b_s he says you wanna be creative get a good night's sleep i like that mhm good um i can't wait to get up and start the day oh um if if that happens it's gradual i'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life with what p eh you mean no i don't think so no i haven't be diagnosed <diag> no i haven't been xxx diagnosed with any psychological acronym <laughter> no <deep breath> uh <sigh> this weekend had a good good time with friends we had a great mm was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and uh for <fo> conversation lasted for two and a half hour three hours didn't expect it to happen it was good i like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare it's almost like running <ru> uh the high you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing i um <sigh> either with friends or working on my stuff my writing or exercising my heighth <laughter> i wish i were taller um i wish mm taller uh physical <phys> just physicality um i wish i didn't wear glasses mhm nothing internal mm i'm patient i've been commended for my patience by strangers um mm my relationships with my friends and my family i understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and i take that time and energy well that's a really open general question of course you know it goes back um are you talking recently are you talking in the past <pa> um i always regret <sigh> things <th> i regret this is a little thing it's not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day it's a little thing <laughter> you know so i hate wasting time i hate wasting money i hate wasting energy <deep breath> <sigh> hm that's a deep question <sigh> i'd say i was codependant ten or twenty years ago i'd say get some help get some help you're co you're co mm k sure bye 
<synch> yeah sure i'm fine thank you i am from los angeles well you can't beat the weather um and i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here smog uh rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no i just think seeing different places it's um learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest um let's see i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat too many to mention i i don't even know where to start suppose it depends on the situation um i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax <sigh> in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter> ah probably argued with my roommate <psh> couple days ago but uh that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of um kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along it's cool i mean guess you know like we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool hmm how much time do we have uh <laughter> it's just too numerous to mention um i i i wouldn't know how to answer that i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasn't going to work um that was very difficult just weighed pros and cons and just thought it just wasn't going to work um no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship there was something missing and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and just knew it was over no so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that the same girl that i broke up with she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine uh they were separated for for several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i i would've handled that better <scoff> um it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister my older sister um she's just strong no nonsense uh she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh uh she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way uh suppose it depends on my stress level um when i have a lot on my mind i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um tired listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well i feel good mm no not really um no no i i wouldn't say i have no i have not yes i have i was diagnosed probably about about five years ago i think uh i always knew there was a problem i always knew there was some i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help think just uh lethargy uh uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there um think normal depression type things uh um social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was you know quite talkative <laughter> i do i'm sorry say again gotcha um it does i think it does well um <sigh> i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to to step back from certain situations and not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part now it's becoming it it it's becoming routine uh initially it was very difficult when i was five years old <laughter> oh no when <wh> when you're a kid there's nothing really to um there's nothing to be sad about you're a kid my best friend um a jerk i don't yeah uh i have a dry i have a dry sense of humor so uh you know my best friend would probably uh i think the the banter back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know it's all in love um i wish i could be taller i wish i could be more inclined to play basketball so i then become go to the n_b_a and be a millionaire i know that's all unrealistic but just answering honestly hmm anything i regret haven't we asked asked this before i mean so many don't know where to start mm that's a good one wow um wow i don't know i you know that's a good one i'd have <ha> i'd have to think about that i don't i wouldn't wanna answer that uh that's a good one usually you're asked um what you'd what you know how you feel ten twenty years from now looking back i don't know what advice i'd give myself something i really enjoyed um hmm i love um there are several things i like to do um uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i i love watching it i love watching all sports for that matter what brings me real joy the past few years was um become a hobby of mine is is uh rescuing dogs fostering dogs and finding them them homes uh it's <laughter> i guess it's become quite a a hobby of mine and uh sometimes i find lost dogs and i'm able to find their owner and sometimes i'm not so when i'll tell you what there's nothing <noth> to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found eh there is not greater feeling 'cause the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his um how his <hi> how his daughter or was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool i think for somebody that um didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that i uh i take pride in though i don't show it or speak about it often <laughter> yeah you look you look like my friend rachel it's funny <laughter> 
<synch> yes i'm doing good i was born in lynwood i like all the sightseeing and all the clothing and stores that they have well some things all the graffiti um basically all the wrongdoing criminal activity and all that bad stuff i've traveled in the past um i don't really go out of state basically budget money money budget expenses doesn't limit me to go to another state i studied automotive technology and welding just a passion for cars since i was little uh always basically just wanted to work on cars pretty yeah i really love working on cars my dream job would probably be probably to own my own automotive shop or to own a barber shop or to just basically be a probably a master welder consider myself a little more outgoing just because i like having fun being uh just having fun with my friends being able to do anything i please basically just smoke on my free time sometimes or just lay down watch a movie listen to some music basically hip hop music or maybe a good comedy movie uh fairly easy about it i don't really let go get let my bad side get to my emotions probably earlier today about with my girlfriend or wife basically about where we gonna go eat felt desperate for an answer for her to tell me where she wanted to go eat since she wouldn't make up her mind kinda made me uneasy probably just to relax and stay calm more than just to outburst and raise my voice wrongdoings in my past basically anything i could've changed mm to better myself basically uh doing something better at a job that or maybe uh not doing the job at my greatest hardest decision would have to be uh to plan a family probably uh just basically making sure all the situations are where they're supposed to be and talking it out with my partner if we're really ready to begin a family <clears throat> just basically the love and bond between me and my wife um basically might be like a crash accident uh basically pretty horrific scary experience when uh i almost crashed into the freeway barrier and the car spun out and it basically almost ended up off of a little hill it was a pretty scary experience as far as just uh being in a car by myself not being able to control the vehicle at all and just hoping that i was gonna be okay it's fairly easy except <exc> if as long as i've had a good dinner early on in my day fairly would go to sleep pretty good just restless and just a little more stressed constant things more would be on my mind lack of energy maybe xxx pretty relaxed calm not really just same old me day through day just try to stay happy and relaxed calm just try to stay positive energy no i have not being diagnosed no i have not been diagnosed by depression um earlier today when i had some food um it's pretty close bonded it was good we talk about a lot of necessary stuff try to help each other out at all times uh my father my sister my mother well my father's been there for as long as my mother has been and she they've both helped me as much as possible from school to clothing to hmm uh takes me to my sister she's basically graduated from college so she's like a a mentor to me kind of look up to her as far as graduating school and everything try to keep going mm they're pretty fun they're outbursting minds basically just smarter kinda seem more advanced thinking compared to what the kids were probably thinking back in the the old age they learn things a little more quicker uh no not majorly just things that i could've thought i could've done better or or just a little differently uh like building my car differently um getting traffic violations basically just uh kinda wish i wouldn'ta sped through intersections or gotten all those tickets i've received on my record yeah i would've basically just after you realize it the first time try not to do it again so the same mistake doesn't happen uh just my persona kind of as far as uh whenever i'm angry just to find a way to be more easygoing maybe try to not be so much of a negative thinker at times when when things get a little harder <clears throat> uh basically when somebody accuses you of wrongdoing that probably has hasn't been done um basically when a police officer tells you you've done wrong when you clearly know that you have not done anything wrong probably earlier this year basically a police officer pulled me over for thinking that i was a drunk driver made me feel really really dumb about myself or tried to accuse me of wrongdoing that i've been drinking and smoking when that was not the cause i was just very tired that night it was twelve a_m therefore i was trying i was i looked probably a little sleepy just uh fun cool easygoing good attitude um loyal <l> xxx loyal um drifting drifting my two forty s_x um spending quality time with my my wife and kids um basically everything i've done for myself from when i graduated high school up to now thank you bye 
<synch> yes i am i'm doing very good today i'm originally from chicago illinois moved out here when i was three yes i never go back family issues it depends on what you're into if you're into um the fast life and hollywood it doesn't compare at all um if you're into the cold weather then you would rather be out there i i like the sun i'll my mom and my dad split up <laughter> it's okay i have no idea i was only three when i moved out here i like the sunshine i like the weather i like the balance of the weather we have in the spring winter fall and and and the summer i like the beaches i like hollywood i like that the lakers are here and and <laughter> i love um the people is it's a different variety i think l_a is a microcosm of the united states people from all over the world come to the united states and people from all over the country and all over the world they come to l_a for a better opportunity so that's what i like about l_a oh gang violence <laughter> no not really i've traveled one time to arizona and one time to stockton california and another time to barstow california but i don't do much traveling right now mainly because of finances i studied alcohol and drug counseling i just felt it in my i just felt it in my heart that that's what i was supposed to be doing with my life is helping people overcome their addictions so um that was a kinda easy choice i got some advice from people and i just went into it to do it just just to see what it was and i finished school and did a intership and got hired and so i believe that's what i'm supposed to be doing with my life i'm not working right now i actually moved away and i had to <deep breath> i was married and we had to move away we moved away because rent was cheaper so i actually had to give up that job um in order to make that move but since i came back down i've been filling out applications and sending resumes and trying to get interviews so i can get back into counseling well it can be it can be very difficult at times because um i have a felony uh and and so i can't work with the youth and i can't work with the elderly and but the regular dopes i can and then you have to be certified and i'm not certified yet you have to work a certain amount of hours in order to be certified before they even allow you to take the test you have to work a certain amount of hours so right now i'm just trying to get into um interns you know try to intern and show people what i can do as a counselor because everything about me is not seen on my resume and um yeah they just want people to be certified um not being certified um the experience and the fact that i have a felony makes it hard <laughter> my dream job is to open my own facility um or or as an author you know that depends <de> that depends on on on people mainly i mainly adapt my personality to the people that i'm around if people are perky then i'm gonna be perky if they're standoffish then i may seem shy but i'm not shy i'm just giving 'em their space and allowing them to decide when they wanna open up but if people open up right away then i open up right away <laughter> i i mainly listen to music or i watch youtube write poetry um or i just close my eyes and just lay down and pretend like i can sing which i can't so <laughter> that's and another thing i do is i eat ice cream <laughter> controlling my temper i'm very very good at it it depends on what it is i have to say that last time i lost my temper it was because i felt like somebody was um scaring my mother so i lost my temper but ninety nine times out of hundred i don't lose my temper don't like to raise my voice and i just like to be calm and cool and i like everybody to be comfortable i don't want anybody to be frightened or anything there's no reason for anybody to be frightened and for us to be angry and you know taking out our past frustrations out on people who had nothing to do with it i just believe that and and i believe um angry outbursts to be a link to um heart problems and high blood pressure so i definitely don't want that well i was just telling you about um it was it was my mother's husband and to tell you the truth um i could've handled that differently but when i seen the look in my mama's eyes of fear i just lost it and i snapped you know i told my mother uh like um i don't like this uh you need you need to take care of this because i'm don't know how long i can keep my composure as far as this 'cause i've been seeing this guy mistreat my mother mistreat my mother but that's her husband and so i kept my distance in their relationship but when i saw her having fear in her eyes that triggered a part of me um that i don't like very much because i know if i get angry i usually stay angry for a long time so i should've just left i should've just left and then went home and rested and got up in the next morning went to church but um yeah it we had a big time explosion and that created and that created a lot of damage for about six to nine months so yeah those six nine months i can't get back yes well my brother's in prison um i haven't seem him in twenty years he's been there twenty years my sister moved to chicago thirteen years ago i haven't seen her since then so i'm only close to my mother and um my son i haven't seen him in five years and i'm still looking for him and waiting for the day i see him again and how that's gonna turn out for me i've just you know i have small family and i have family in chicago but i don't mess around with that side of the family just just because um of what i seen and heard so i just don't want it to happen to me at all so i just keep my distance someone who's been a positive influence <inf> influence in my life i would say scrubbed_entry taught me how to get my temper under control and how to express my emotions without me <m>  me expressing my emotions being threatening to someone else and taught taught me how how to like monitor my emotions and monitor my thoughts and how strong my thoughts are and when they're really strong that's when i just need to be quiet until that intense fizzling subsides and then i can speak rationally and not just emotionally um and of course um he's he was the one that encouraged <enc> told me that i should look into being a drug and alcohol counselor um he got twenty seven years clean and sober right now he used to live on skid row and he <h> the way he changed his life around and you know the way he approached me as a father was just something that i'll never forget feel guilty about my grandfather um passed away in two thousand four and at that time i was just getting out of prison um two thousand two i was just getting out of prison and he came to see me and he told me in so many words that he wasn't gonna be around for that much longer but i didn't get it 'cause i had a lot of drugs and alcohol in my life at the time and my life was crowded with things that i considered to be more important than that plus the fact i didn't understand him what he was saying but when he died i figured out that he was telling me that i should probably spend more time with him before it's time for him to go but i couldn't see it then and i feel i think about it all the time something i can erase from my memory huh would be the day my brother hit my mom i always replay that over and over and over and over in my mind and it's like that's one memory i just i can just go without replaying in my mind over and over and over and over and over again so yeah that day that memory right there i felt conflicting feelings because on one hand on one hand my brother was protecting me from getting beat and on the other hand he was hitting my mom so was kinda in the middle uh most nights i don't i go to sleep maybe three in the morning and i'm probably <prob> i'm more than likely up at seven in the morning so i don't get much sleep it it depends it depends on the environment i'm in um if i don't sleep well i'm going eventually i'm gonna be irritable but it doesn't happen right away it depends on my environment and who's around me if there are difficult people that's gonna be a challenge for me and um if people are easygoing no one will even know that i didn't get much sleep how i been feeling lately i just been feeling like that things are about to start going better for me um making some better decisions um taking advantage of the opportunities that come to me taking advantage of my talents taking advantage of meeting the right people that can um open the right doors for me so i'm very enthusiastic about that even if it doesn't happen i'll send out a million resumes i don't care if i get five interviews i'm i will never stop because i know know that being a counselor is my life mission and and um i'm also destined to be a writer and it's just a matter of time before my book is out there and people um know about me because i've had a lot of time to study human behavior and things like that and i have a lot to offer humanity so it's just a matter of time before um the that the public is exposed to what um i've been gathering my behavior i'm more mellow um i laugh more more humorous i let a lot of things go that i used to just let tick me off and anger me and things that i can't control like trying to control people or or or trying to make sure people don't betray me and mm you <y> you just can't control that i think i matured mentally and psychologically eh and the um acquisition of a sense of humor was a major major breakthrough for me so i know my thoughts have changed and with my thoughts changing my behavior has changed i still have to monitor it um my thoughts and my behavior i still have to monitor them but overall i'm you know um back then i just tolerated myself now i um actually like myself and um it will behoove <beh> behoove you to feel the same way no no i haven't no last time i felt happy was last night 'cause the lakers won the basketball game <laughter> yeah my best friend would describe me um he calls me the truth because i always tell the truth and people try to hide stuff and i always reveal it they can't hide it from me um i have a statement that says i see through you like a clear glass with nothing in it and i see stuff days and months before they start happening i i know human behavior when i see it and i sniff it out real well and it's just a gift that was given to me so he calls me the truth um because of how i interact with people and how people um have to come clean with me because when they look at me they know that i see through them like i said like a clear glass with nothing in it and yes that's why he calls me the truth <laughter> um i wish i would've never well obviously i wish i would've never went to prison um i wish that i could change well um my economic status my employment status and um my teeth that's like a problem area for me i did a lot of stupid things years ago and they caught up with me and i didn't take care of my teeth and now that i need to be um confident about myself as i can be you know it always comes up every now and then you know the thought like i wonder if they looking at my teeth i wonder if they're looking at my teeth i never get the sign <si> i never get the impression that they are but in the back of my mind there's these thoughts that says are they looking at my teeth so i would really change that and i would change my physical um size i think i would like to be at least thirty five pounds heavier but i'm working on it twenty years ago which would make me eighteen i would've at that time i was a big time um high school basketball player for fremont high school and i had colleges coming to see me and i would've given myself the opportunity was to stay away from the troublemakers because i didn't and i blew my opportunity to play college basketball for duke blue devils and who knows i could've been playing for the lakers last night but hey i'm most proud of the fact that you know what i'm most proud of my mom really really um she graduated from school she had a full-time job she had a full-time job um she would wake up at five in the morning go to work get off her job at three thirty go straight to the college leave the college at nine o'clock at night she does this five days a week and still had the strength to maintain um she was on the dean's list and the president's list so doing all of this you know when they say xxx that older people can't do things i i just think that dispels that rumor um and she recently got her um license as a evangelist in the church so i'm just real proud of that and um her life has been affecting people in a in a positive way so yeah my mom <laughter> okay thank you goodbye 
<synch> mm yes mm i'm doing pretty good uh i was born in los angeles mhm um i like the diversity of the city all the attractions and things that you can see um the food restaurants things like that traffic freeways crime mm uh yes i do mhm um seeing new places or going back and seeing same places and just enjoying relaxing getting away from l_a uh well let's see last trip i made was up to the central coast up in uh cambria and pismo beach area and um solvang santa ynez uh huh yeah probably uh when i got to study abroad in madrid spain when i was a student at u_c_l_a uh huh in terms of travel uh yeah i was um i participated in the uh education abroad program at u_c_l_a where you go live in another country to learn the language and you live there for a year at the university <univers> and you study at the university and uh it it was just a memorable year something <someth> an experience that i would never <laughter> forget thanks probably more shy but uh sometimes i could be outgoing um i'm more shy in terms of you know i it takes me it takes time <t> time for me to get to know people i mean i'm not a real party person i don't like to go to parties and meet people and things like that but if i if i'm among friends and things like that then i can be pretty outgoing with people i know <laughter> <laughter> <laughter> um drink wine um yeah drink wine maybe listen to some uh nice music pretty good i can i'm pretty good at controlling my emotions oh gosh um i wouldn't say it was a real argument it was more like a what just a discussion maybe about finances maybe money um just oh just a little irritated <laughter> but um not really not really strong emotional uh wow gosh i <laughter> i can't think of anything at the moment so uh let's uh skip that one um mm maybe uh eating eating more junk food than i admit to or the hardest decision i ever had to make uh maybe uh buying a home <h> buying a home or remodeling the home spending money for uh i it was um i felt it was time to move on with my life and uh to uh buy a place for myself so i could be self-sufficient and independent xxx yes very happy thank you uh an event i could erase from my uh when i um yeah when i was a student <stud> when i was a student teaching for a year trying to get my teaching credential and discovered i never enjoyed it i wanna erase that whole year nineteen eighty three uh it just brought back horrible <laughter> it just brings back <laughter> horrible memories of uh what i went through when i was student teaching and uh discovered that that teaching k twelve was not was <w> not for me i studied <stud> my major was spanish and linguistics i was very good at foreign languages and i thought um i enjoyed taking them and i was just having a good time taking foreign language and uh i was getting good grades so i thought maybe this is what i should go into foreign languages uh i was teaching <teachi> i was an adult ed teacher teaching english as a second language for thirty years and i just recently uh decided to uh retire myself um i have a pretty good relationship with my family with my mother and my sisters my father passed away in two thousand eight and um uh my relationship with my father wasn't as good as with my other family members yeah but uh on the xxx on the whole um we have pretty good relation with the rest of my family now um pretty easy i

pretty good no major health problems or anything no no no uh last time i was really happy uh probably uh when spring break came around it was uh vacation time and it was time to uh <laughter> go on our trip uh yeah it was um it was a week trip up to central coast to uh cambria and pismo beach and santa ynez it was just a nice getaway relaxing on the uh <laughter> hotel lawn and garden drinking wine and uh enjoying different sights and eating good food and <laughter> and buying wine to replenish our dwindling supply at home <laughter> thanks uh i think she would describe me as um eh kind and sweet and um motivated and uh just a nice person oh i'd say sometimes i wouldn't mind being a little more outgoing i guess i tend to be more reserved so i wouldn't mind being more outgoing towards strangers and things but mm uh really badly about myself uh let's see probably when i betrayed a confidence with some friends of mine when i uh taped them when i taped them singing christmas carols and i i played it to some other people and they found out and they really laid a guilt trip on me for doing that yeah but uh it all it all got resolved at the end we all <laughter> we became <beca> we were all <laughter> it was just a bad misunderstanding on my part but it worked out okay yeah um probably having done what i did by <laughter> playing it to other people uh what advice would i give myself ten or twenty years ago um uh don't give up just uh keep uh <laughter> keep pursuing what you want and uh never never give up xxx see it as a and as a disappointment if nothing <noth> if it doesn't work out um i'm a i'm a good listener um i'm a i'm a motivated person i'm hardworking i'm conscientious i'm caring um i'm generally a pretty happy type person something recently what i really

the most memorable thing in my life something i'll never forget great one son grown handsome father of two no it's actually very hard for me not becoming angry too quickly being able to cultivate a mind love someone unconditionally well i went through a lot of trauma as a child so as a parent i was very afraid for my child to go through that same trauma tried to protect him from it i think it's really hard 'cause you never really know people what they'll do outgoing because if i'm in a room with people i'm usually the first one to start talking as a matter of fact i have fish aquarium that's what keeps me calm not very good <laughter> seems like everyday i argue with somebody about something but yesterday um a lady tried to cut line in the grocery store and i politely told her i was in line and she didn't wanna move  yes it has because sometimes if people don't want to move then i feel it's my place to move them hurting people physically uh if i feel disrespected or somebody puts their hands on me i can get very ugly i don't like that about me um i was pulled over by the police and they had uh someone with my name and they were very rude to me and i really wasn't happy with the way they treated me um how to stay calm when someone has crossed over into my boundary my personal space i can't let people get too close to me if they do i i lash out i don't want anybody in my  area of protection i guess stay away from people <laughter> stay away from it's hard you can't live in this world without other people sometimes they just irritate the heck out of me being assaulted in the military is something i wish i could forget just that i felt helpless alone ashamed and angry that's about all i wanna go into eighteen yeah very young no because i was assaulted and and i have a fear of people in uniform like the policemen hurting me or um other military veterans hurting me when they explode or go off or have issues of p_t_s_d i can't remember i worked for the federal government well it just seemed like a normal progression um federal government gives you ten points preference over other people for being in the military so it seemed like a natural choice a organization that had a book of rules and they followed them the government one government to another yes well it was hard in the sense that in the military you're given um you're told to handle it handle it and in the civilian world you have to go through so many hoops and different people to talk to to get something done administration of justice no um i don't work anymore oh yeah almost two years the feeling that i was always gonna be hurt that someone was out to get me i had nightmares panic attacks anxiety attacks outburts <out> outburts of anger i was always in emotional pain and i always wanted to hit somebody yes mostly disrespect but i feel it's disrespect of people getting too close to me or i feel in fear of them for some reason i can't remember the last time i had a good night's sleep what irritable angry moody pissed off irrational tired sick of the world angry at the world wanting to be left alone sometimes i don't wanna go on yes oh yeah <laughter> oh yeah well i i could recognize a trigger now when something is gonna trigger me i can at least know and uh act  accordingly if i want to <laughter> when i saw my grandchildren when they came to visit <sniff> they're just so innocent and sweet and precious it was just a joy to have them around they make me forget about all the pain in life <sniff> <sniff> planting seeds for some vegetables making a garden <sniff> i read somewhere that it's calming and soothing to work with your hands and dirt so i decided to find out <sniff> plant something and watch it grow <sniff> sitting on the beach looking <look> facing the water thinking talking to god wishing i were somewhere else like hawaii penthouse over maui that i could trust people that i wouldn't lash out at them that i could sleep at night <sniff> crazy hot headed <sniff> emotional being in the wrong place at the wrong time don't trust anyone be careful be wary of people and what they want from you my son my grandchildren <sniff> i don't have a a real family i don't haven't seen my brothers in like twenty thirty years i only have two brothers and i don't haven't seen them my mother's family i haven't seen in years my father's family i haven't seen in years my parents are dead my son lives in another state wow some of the older people that i give care to sometimes i'm a caregiver so sometimes the people that i work with older and wiser <sniff> i'm loyal spiritual supportive kind generous bye 
<synch> sure good indiana um the weather i like the weather uh never um didn't wanna get back into the old groove i took some time took a long time took a few years yeah um it doesn't get very cold um i'm more comfortable with the uh environment than the midwest uh the smog uh the crowds um the dirt um mm the hustle yeah no no i haven't for a while uh money takes uh takes a lot of money or credit cards yeah uh just the basics i didn't go very long <sigh> just uh dream <drea> uh my dream job is um some developing land yeah building high-rise buildings probably in the middle uh well i'm not real shy uh and i'm not really outgoing so i'd say uh fifty fifty uh i usually walk walk around the neighborhood or uh listen to music uh <sigh> above average uh <sigh> with someone uh <sigh> hmm it's been awhile eh i think it was about very little uh i don't remember the exact time but it's it was uh something very little uh xxx um ba ba ba just uh instead of getting uh angry just uh ignoring people ignoring them mm <sigh> guess it's fifty fifty sometimes uh what do i feel guilty about <makes sound with mouth> can't think of anything right now <sigh> uh <sigh> what could i erase let's see um a career choice that i made years ago uh i got into the transportation business i went to school and then got employed and then i stayed with it for a few years dream job is um developing land construction high-rise building hardest decision <decisi> you ever had to make hmm can't think of one um not much of one to speak of it's kinda distant mm yeah we don't we talk couple times a year that's about it <sniffle> uh not many people <laughter> mm good night's sleep yeah uh i'd say uh eh it's off and on uh tired uh kind of uh mm ouch kinda like um <sigh> here and there looking searching yeah looking for a job looking for employment <emplo> employment hmm not too much no no no oh i had a dream a few days <d> weeks ago a few days ago and i was really happy in the dream yeah uh i don't remember the dream it was um <makes sound with mouth> not sure what it was about <deep breath> uh <sigh> don't do too much uh go to the library uh park not too much yeah <sigh> i don't have any best qualities uh good listener mm my penis size mm don't remember yeah there's <sigh> there's a few things yep uh i regret uh um <makes sound with mouth> what do i regret uh can't think of anything in particular there's probably a list somewhere to uh to uh meditate more uh uh smelly people they stink music comedies funny movies hmm uh really enjoyed wow hasn't been too much of that listen to music mostly uh yesterday very little goodbye 
<sync> yes i'm fine i'm doing very well today i feel good today uh born in indiana mhm grew up in bloomington i moved to l_a for a job working with the c_d_c i've only been back twice in the past twenty years um my family is not there anymore uh i went back for high school reunions it's much greener it's very green uh very small um uh very um wooded areas that's where i played in the woods when i was a a kid we'd swim in the quarries um i rode my bicycle everywhere and here it's a little um more uh cement and traffic um it was <wa> it just seemed like cement at first but i love it now and i have friends and i i love being able to do so many different things um and i go to the beach a lot um i still go up to the mountains i go camping all the time um so i i love it i love it always opportunities <laughter> um i have traveled quite a bit i was in the peace corps and i was um <tisk> in south america i was in paraguay for three years and i traveled all through south america brazil peru uh peru chile bolivia um i also spent a year in london traveled all through europe and i used to go to canada often uh i'd love to get to asia one of these days uh meeting new people the food i love trying new food um and just getting a different perspective on the world and different people's um outlook on the world and because america tends to become isolated um i hiked the inca trail when i was in um uh peru and that was a five day hike starting out of cusco um we hiked for um i think what four or five days um and woke up one the last morning at the sun gate of machu picchu and that was just an most amazing experience 'cause i would only i'd i'd seen about i'd seen it in national geographic you know all my life um so to be there and experience that was phenomenal philosophy i have my degree in philosophy i minored in art <clears throat> well i started out in business and i got very disenchanted with it very quickly and so i decided to study what i wanted to study while i was in college and had the opportunity so that's what i wanted to do and everyone advised me against it because you can't get a job as a philosopher um but i had the idea of getting my philosophy degree then going to law school and being a professor of ethics um but that kind of fell apart and that's actually how i ended up joining the peace corps <laughter> so it all worked out i'm sorry yeah mhm i'm i'm sorry my alarm's going off on my phone it'll die in a second okay i'm sorry it's still going sorry i turned off the phone but i forgot to turn off the alarm that should go okay what i'm sorry what was your question my dream job um <sigh > gosh um writing um i've done a few um uh scripts uh some screeenplays with a friend of mine um but i don't really wanna do the hollywood thing um <tisk> but writing and teaching and traveling if i could do that overseas so outgoing should i turn off my alarm <laughter> it keeps going <laughter> here oh i can't move okay i can't get to my purse okay i'm sorry yes i i turned off my phone but i didn't turn off the the alarm is like <laughter> it's like i forgot it's my alarm to go to yoga class i'm terribly sorry about that <laughter> okay <laughter> <laughter> sorry for the interruption um i have a actual fish tank um at my house and i i do the the same thing and i do that with my children when they get upset um the i sit them in front of the fish tank and it's very relaxing um i also try and meditate um i try and and just sit down and be quiet um and gather my thoughts um i like to read and um or sometimes i i walk or i'll take my dog for a walk <sigh> i wish i could say i was good at it but usually i um i tend to have outbursts every once in a while um when things are getting too chaotic at my house um and i'm feeling very underappreciated i will have a burst of anger yeah my husband doesn't appreciate that um and i i i've never done it at work or in a social situation but at home with my family i've done it and then instead of um recognizing that i'm upset about it my husband tends to get mad at me for being mad and then that escalates and uh sometimes i just end up walking out the door or going to my room hmm i'm sorry um i i usually after i have an outburst and i isolate myself for a little bit i can come back relaxed and deal with the situation in a more calm manner um sometimes it's very hard but i i i've gotten to the point where i know just to stop and and get myself out of there and and go take some deep breaths um and then really try and figure out what i'm feeling why i'm being angry why why am i being um so tense and then be able to verbalize that um well i i it happens a few times when i start getting i've had a very tense day um and things haven't gone right um i tend to have outbursts in the kitchen while i'm  making dinner and the kids are all home and they're asking me questions about their homework or they're turning on the t_v or and my husband's uh uh bothering me about things that i just don't need to think about right then and one time i just said okay everyone out of the kitchen leave me alone get out just let me finish dinner and nobody would and i just it just had more pressure building up and building up and i actually took one of the pots and just banged it against the stove <laughter> really hard to just like get people to pay attention to what i was saying it actually made a dent in my stove <laughter> um which is still there um so that that i i should have um walked out sooner and taken my deep breaths before i did that um it was probably when i was pregnant with my first child um i wasn't married um <tisk> i had a very good friend um oh i was i was thirty two at the time so i was uh you know i wasn't young i think if i was younger i probably would have decided to have an abortion but at that point in my life i'm like okay i'm i'm going to have this um and i had um i i got pregnant by the man i actually married and still married to um but we'd only been dating like three months and i was living with a a good friend of mine who i had been in the peace corps with um and she and so i didn't know this guy very well um i didn't know if we could raise a child together i didn't know if i wanted to get married and raise a child with somebody else um and my friend suggested that we raise the child together um even suggested moving to costa rica to raise the child together um and uh so it was a lot of um huge decisions that were gonna determine the rest of my life um and i made the decision based on more common sense and practicality um but i don't regret that decision i think i made a good decision to marry my husband and raise our child <laughter> um they're older now my uh my eldest is seventeen he is um <tisk> at da vinci science uh school and he's very much into engineering he is getting his pilot's license uh which i'm very proud of him for um then my daughter is fifteen and she loves acting uh she um she has a boyfriend who um uh they see just once a week at church basically um and they text each other constantly um she's a very very typical fifteen year old and then i have a twelve year old he is extremely active <laughter> and is in constant motion and is always making noises but i love him dearly um he is into rock climbing and there's a rock climbing gym near our house so he has a membership there so he goes over there and rock climbs almost on a daily basis no i find it extremely difficult i don't i wasn't my mother had a very difficult <d> my dad died when i was young and um my mother kind of disconnected when that happened um so i didn't have a very warm or loving relationship with my mother or growing up and i basically raised myself i was um kind of on my own from a very young age um i mean she was at the house but really had no interaction with her so i really didn't have parenting skills that you know most people are are raised with um i know what not to do but sometimes it's very difficult and um i i see my friends that have you know these very innate parenting skills these very warm and you know they're making cookies and everything's organic and they knit everything and you know their house is always perfect um and it's like i i'm just not that person so i i i try and be i'm i i think i am a very good mother but i'm not um a typical mother i think i'm more um i'm more creative a lot of times i and we do a lot of things um but it's not a warm fuzzy cozy kind of thing actually when we go camping it's more i'm more homey when i go camping than i am at home i think i'm more tense when i'm at home but i'm trying to like through meditation and things of that sort i'm trying to become calmer and more patient i think my patience is what um i need to work on the most i'm a been an insomniac all my life i remember as a child laying in my bed watching the stars go across the my bedroom window and um i haven't slept well for a long time um but i realize that if i exercise and i do something with my brain intellectually during the day i have to be physically tired and intellectually tired to sleep well um and that's sometimes that's hard to do um and so a lot of times i stay <s> i stay awake reading i'll read 'til midnight um and then i'll try and go to sleep um and usually i won't get back up even if i i'll wake up at three again and things of that sort but i'll try to go back to sleep yesterday i didn't feel so good i was um i think a lot of it has to depend on the weather  and it was all cloudy and grey yesterday um 'cause i planned on planned on working on my garden and then i'm i'm building <buil> i'm making a butterfly garden in my front yard um so i had some more planting to do and i just couldn't didn't kind of feel like doing it um so i just sort of puddled about and wasted a lot of time yesterday but  today i feel really good so i feel more positive i feel more energy so no no um i don't know i just got a new mattress actually that hasn't really helped me sleep but um it was really good because i needed one for a really long time and it i was just kind of excited about being delivered <deli> it delivered and and set up and and that sounds like sort of mundane um but it was you know just like i'm finally doing something positive 'cause it's it's something that i put off doing and put off doing and put off doing and it was like finally uh there and concrete and it's like okay i've done this task that i can check off my list um but also i took the kids camping over um spring break and uh we just had a fabulous time and we sat around telling stories and  um around the camp fire and making s'mores and things like that and those kind of times make me very happy <laughter> i don't know um i think she believes that i'm uh uh more intellectual and smarter than i think that i am at times so she comes to me with a lot of um issues uh she always she always solicits advice from me she thinks i give her good advice um and when she doesn't know what to do she'll she'll she'll ask me um and then sometimes she just calls me to run things by uh or just like to complain about because i'm sympathetic um or empathetic and uh i just i'm just there to listen and i don't need to give her any advice so i think a a good listener and good advice giver i procrastinate a lot um i start projects and i don't finish them uh so that's what i'm working on right now is finishing up a lot of projects that i've started over the past few months a lot of them are really creative projects and um i'm very enthusiastic about them when i when i start them and i'll get almost finished and then i don't know what happens i just completely lose interest um sometimes i think it's because i'm afraid to finish them which sounds a little strange but um i i'm working on that i'm trying to get those done oh gosh <laughter> um not following through on the opportunities i had when i got out of the peace <p> peace corps there was a lot of things that i could go into i could've gone to get my master's degree um with on a grant and things of that sort um but instead i got pregnant and got married and i had a wonderful job that i really liked and really enjoyed um but then when i got pregnant the second time it was right at a time where i had to fight for a directorship and i realized my limitations where i i couldn't be pregnant and have this child and and do everything i needed to do to get a directorship and so i really wish so i resigned um and i wish i had stuck with that um 'cause then i would have a have had a much more fulfilling and rewarding and solid career um not base decisions on emotions sometimes i um and not i i've had some really bad bosses um the jobs were wonderful um but my ego got in the way and i would've told myself to let go of that aspect of the job let go of the the egotistical reactions that i had to the bosses and concentrate on the job and doing that really well um my children actually um and also uh my peace corps experience was just phenomenal um and uh people are actually really interested in that and they were like an awe that they actually know someone who actually did that um so that that's i'm yeah i always when i was a little girl my neighbor was one of the first people to go into the peace corps when it first started and i always said oh i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day i wanna do that one day and then finally i got to the point where so i'd i either had to shut up or do it um so that's that was one of my prouder experiences okay thank you bye 
<synch> yes i feel great i am from los angeles california um the weather the opportunity and the ocean it's overcrowded overpriced and somewhat dirty i have well it's nice to see other places in the world and to meet other people and cultures i worked on cruise ships as a musical entertainer and traveled to alaska the aleutian islands korea japan and the caribbean islands um being in galena alaska and being on a small airplane and traveling in a snow storm and surviving like i was on the edge of death and life but i lived the arts and business i don't know i was attracted to the arts at a young age and business went along with it yes yes to be able to entertain people and make them feel emotions and make enough money to have a comfortable life more outgoing um i always feel <fee> i feel very confident with my thoughts and i like people to know what i have to say um i listen to music and i sit with my girlfriend and she calms me down when i'm stressed out i could work on that i'm not very good at that last night with my girlfriend she was asking my advice on something and as i was speaking to her she felt my tone of voice was too loud i was not angry but i was irritated that i was being told to quiet down when i didn't really wanna help i just wanted to relax <laughter> i agree um sometimes when things don't go my way i get depressed or upset and i wish i could calm down and just realize that i should count my blessings and look at the bright side of everything no matter how bad things get always look at the bright side that's my goal it's been very difficult but i'm working on it and it seems to be getting a little easier well when i was taking care of my mother and she was dying of c_o_p_d and then it turned into lung cancer i chose not to tell her that her condition had worsened so she wouldn't be fearful and i had to sit knowing that her symptoms were getting worse but i couldn't tell her the truth and i let her think that everything was okay it was uh my mother being sick and dependent on oxygen for three years and me seeing her health decline that's what plagues me the most in my dreams and in my thoughts if i could erase that if that never happened i would feel better oh i don't know i try to uh be grateful i'm alive and try to focus on my own objectives and not dwell on the negative things of my memory my girlfriend she's a very good positive <po> positive influence she wants me to be a better person she since i met her she's been trying to make me not be angry to make me not feel negative and to be a nurturing positive zen-like man so what she's asking for is something that's gonna make me improve therefore i must capitulate it's very easy i sleep well sometimes i wake up when i have nightmares about my mother or something but uh i go back to sleep that's unknown i don't know it just happens i've been feeling uh good eh the my reality is i've been hit with a lot of financial uh problems but i'm handling <ha> handling them well actually i've been looking at it as my girlfriend has told me that i need to do this so therefore it is on the forefront of my mind right now no no today when i woke up and it was a sunny beautiful day and i had a lot of goals to achieve and i'm achieving each one one by one it gives me a sense of accomplishment and happiness my ideal weekend would be playing music with my girlfriend as that's something we enjoy to do healthy <hea> going out to a nice dinner of healthy food and maybe exercising and feeling good with my body and mind and spirit uh probably as a strong-willed person with a big heart but has a short fuse and maybe complains about his own life too much i wish i could not complain about negative things that happen and learn to roll with the punches and always look at the bright side well one time i had a good friend tell me that one of the recordings i did he thought was horrible and then i felt it was the best thing i'd ever done so that and i would don't understand how anybody could could feel that way and i didn't know if it was from jealousy or it was an honest opinion <opi> evaluation so therefore i felt bad about that as it's my goal no nothing i regret i felt hmm ten or twenty years ago i don't know um <sigh> well everything i do i enjoy it's hard to to pick out one exact event that i really enjoyed uh i don't know how to put one above the other when things don't go my way and finances xxx come down and i don't get jobs that i go for that i am qualified for but i feel i am not getting my fair chance at opportunity it's very frustrating i don't really feel guilty about things sometimes maybe if i'm angry and i shouldn't be i feel guilty about that i don't ever wanna be short with my girlfriend ever she wouldn't doesn't deserve somebody um using vulgar language or shouting or something so i don't wanna be that way around her so therefore that i am guilty my achievements of my abilities through my music and my other abilities that i have and of my hard work has paid off and uh i'm very proud of those okay thank you goodbye 
<synch> yes i'm wonderful how are you california mhm yes the weather is one of 'em uh the food um and the way uh everything is centrally located mhm the traffic the smog and um it's just gotten really really overcrowded um i wouldn't say a lot but i do try to um travel um at least once once or twice every two years um just exploring different things and being able to um have different experiences um things of that nature and you know learning new things and um just different cultures uh i like to um learn about different cultures and when you travel um you get a sense of um you know feedback from different cultures and different areas so i like that um well i just came from miami uh last year i went to miami for a week and a half and it was really nice the weather was great it was my first time going um and um the weather was wonderful the people are really nice and um it was really a great experience i went out there for um a particular event um they have um something every year um where everyone comes out from all over and uh you just kinda party and hang out and meet new people it was really fun um well from that trip i would say um swimming in the beautiful beautiful beautiful um miami beach waters was wonderful yeah it was um child development mhm well um i've always been interested in children um since i was younger um i babysat a lot so i had a lot of um experience with kids at a young age and as i grew older um i realized that it was something that i liked to do um so uh that's when i um looked into child development courses and i thought that it was something um like that i would enjoy <en> enjoy doing so um i started taking classes and um the rest is history i am yes it's been um fifteen years in august yeah my dream job i would say um to become a principal well it's something that um i've thought about doing for a while now and um i've actually just began the steps to try to get that going so um i'm gonna be back in school and i'm gonna be taking courses um so that i can make that happen because it is a dream of mine yeah thank you um it's gonna be pretty difficult um there is uh several years of schooling that i have ahead of me and um you know it's definitely gonna be a challenge but it's something that i'm up for because it is a dream job of mine so it's something that i'm willing to i'm willing to do um a little bit of both i think a little bit of both i can be shy at times um and and outgoing as well um but i think a little bit of both i would say <laughter> uh i meditate i i'm i'm a big big meditator so i love meditating i love just um reading and just having nice quiet peaceful time oh wow i'm very very good at that very good at controlling my temper i um again um a series of meditation that i do um it involves deep breathing and um just really centering yourself to where you can feel your heart beat and you can um really feel everything in your body and it really really allows you to de-stress and to control anxiety and anger and things of that nature yeah that helps me a lot oh wow it was just recently um actually unfortunately it was last week and it was with my husband and um it was about um just the way he responds sometimes to me uh it can be a little aggressive um and we're just trying to work with that because i don't respond well to aggression i totally tune out and um that's actually what happened so yeah that was it i felt very frustrated um and i actually felt angered too um but more frustrated and i felt saddened too because i don't like arguing so it was a little bit of all those emotions at one time uh <sigh> a situation which i wish i would've handled differently honestly i haven't had a situation like that in in years i've pretty much kind of um you know kind of mastered my responses um to certain um stimuli i've kinda got that down the hardest decision i've ever had to make well it was when i was sixteen years old and i became a teenage um mother i was pregnant at sixteen and um i had um a lot of pressure from family to um give my child up for adoption or to um abort and i chose life so that was that was one of the hardest decisions if not the hardest decisions to make as a sixteen year old teenage um teenager just whether i wanted to continue to be a kid and a teenager or whether i wanted to embark on raising a life um when i was just a child myself so that i think was the hardest decision i had to make um well i mean um my son is almost nineteen now so it's nineteen years later and um i actually um am so glad it was one of the best things that i ever did by not choosing to abort him and choosing <choo> being pro-life pro-choice pro-life and um eh i i have not regretted the decision um that's my only child and i love him he is just a blessing he's just a blessing and i feel very special to be his mom i do yeah um no it's it's not easy uh it definitely um has it's difficulties um just as anything um but at the end of the day it is really rewarding um and you just get to see the life that you brought into the world and that you've raised become a productive citizen and go out into society and just start making their way and it's really rewarding it really is oh wow so many ways um the first way <wa> uh the first way is i actually listen to my son and i um accept his feedback even if i don't like it and i um allow him to express his self fortunately unfortunately when i was little um there was not a lot of um conversation from parent to child um it was more like we were just told you know what to do and we did it um and with my son i give him options i allow him to express his self i allow him to give me feedback um negative or positive because i feel that it's really important for a child to develop their voice at a young age and um as parents you have to be supportive and that and kind of um make sure that you nurture that um because that's kind of um the way that they develop you know and it's really really important so i'm different in um in a lot of ways in that rite thank you um <sigh> well it depends um sometimes it it really depends it depends on the time that i go to sleep it depends on the time that i woke up so it's a lot of factors um i can't just give you one answer um i would say that it varies sometimes i can go to sleep um and fall asleep right away and other times i can go to sleep and it might take awhile to actually fall asleep so it varies i've been feeling great lately i i really have been um i can't um say that like i said the last week didn't affect me um you know the argument with my husband but other than that i i've been feeling really good no i haven't no i have not you know what honestly i feel happy every day you know every day i wake up i'm happy because that is a chance for me to take advantage carpe diem seize the day so um i feel blessed every morning i wake up it's a blessing you know because i realize that some people did not wake up some people are homeless some people are going through so many situations that are really disheartening and that's not me so i feel really really blessed every day thank you um as um nurturing patient loving friendly um kind of reserved um well i wish that i had um already completed college and had my master's degree and sometimes i wish i was a little bit more knowledgeable in certain subjects and um i can change if i can change anything i would change that those two things and also i would be um a little bit more outgoing and less of an introvert you know what no regrets no regrets um you live and learn um nothing is perfect um everything that i've gone through has made me the person that i am today so i wouldn't change anything because i'm happy with the person that i am today oh <sigh> man to stay in school to stay in school and to get your education and put that first and foremost before a relationship even before your career um i really really uh would would've told myself um to stay focused and to get a great education i'm most proud of um where i've come from um as a teenage mother um being a statistic and actually changing that being on my same i've had my uh same job for fifteen years now i'm really proud of that i've been married for thirteen years i'm really proud of that happily married um to my best friend and my soulmate nothing's perfect but um he's my best friend and i love him and i'm also proud of my son um being the mother that i am and the son that i've raised i'm proud of the job that i've done and i'm um i really um applaud myself for that you're welcome you were wonderful thank you buh bye 
<sync> yeah that's perfectly fine i'm feeling great uh it's an early morning i don't have school i'm excited <laughter> uh born and raised in los angeles california mhm uh the fact that you can surf snowboard and like do two drastically different things in one day uh coming from the neighborhoods i've lived in uh <tisk> i'd say the population of uh lower socio economic backgrounds it it's like a cesspool almost for young african americans and it sucks uh not really i've been to new york connecticut mexico and texas but pretty young hmm <laughter> uh mostly if i'm traveling by plane just the sight and the air is amazing it's remarkable uh the first time i went to new york i was about eleven years old and i made sure i got the the window seat on the plane and just the feeling of taking off is just exhilarating but uh we left um <tisk> at night here in l_a and it was the next day in new york so it was kind of confusing getting used to the time change the first thing i remember doing was uh getting a slice of new york pizza it was it was delicious <laughter> yep <laughter> scrubbed_entry graduating with a bachelor's degree in communications so i can go into the military as an officer actually it's like what i don't know it's like you gotta have a plan and that's the only thing that's just fallen into place and it seems like it's going to fall into place for me hmm to be honest a job that doesn't exist <laughter> it's however you can get paid to do nothing <laughter> yeah but uh probably i was just definitely shy as a kid but i've grown into myself through the experience of college so i'm way more outspoken uh i write music and i work out mostly so if i'm feeling stressed out i just do a set of push ups and lift some weights i'm pretty good um i saw a therapist when i was a kid for about a year and uh i don't know it it taught me to just be able to control my emotions and i don't think i do it in the best way because when i'm angry i do decide to like just bottle the my emotions in instead of letting them out in their appropriate outlets uh not really it's been more of uh an interpersonal thing that's i don't i don't know probably yesterday something in regards to sports the playoffs are on so things like that of that nature um <sigh> hm <sigh> so many um i guess in my senior year of high school i waited to the last minute to apply for the u_c schools and it was unsuccessful because i didn't get to turn in the applications and i'm pretty sure i would've been admitted so it sucks but hey that is an intriguing question <sigh> um i've actually no clue the death of my grandmother sure um my grandmother died when i was eleven years old she raised me from the time i was born because my mother was unable to take care of me she raised my sister my brother and my cousin as well and her five children so she was the matriarch of our family and <sigh> the closest thing i've had to a mother and it was it was tough but um it's gonna be seven years this may next on the thirtieth and uh i've grown quite a bit no more tears uh i'm a foster kid so i was emancipated from the foster program uh about two years ago now but um my immediate family i'm pretty close with them and i see them as much as i can and uh my foster family they're awesome i've known them since i was five so it's been pretty cool fairly easy i fall asleep pretty quick it's not a problem except for when my back's hurting you know then it's a problem mm <tisk> a little moody in the morning i guess i drive more aggressively <laughter> uh a little stressed about a few problems that i can take care of but i shouldn't stress because i either can do something about it or i can't and that's just the way things work uh sure um hm hm uh i have uh a few parking ticket not parking tickets they're not moving violations but they're tickets and i was unaware of if you miss court without being in the hospital or being in jail that you couldn't be excused from not making <ma> making your court date so i had three failure to appears in court which sucked tickets that are thousands of dollars and i have no money so i don't know it's it's pretty tough to deal with when you're trying to make something out of your life but there're so many barriers and obstacles that like you have you didn't forsee so i don't know it gets stressful at times and yeah thinking about it for periods of time some days i just sit and i'm just lost in my thoughts and i don't really communicate to anyone because there's nothing anybody can do for me really so i i just bottle it up like i do everything not very after doing it for so long it becomes a natural thing i i i believe no no hm really happy oh why is that such a difficult question uh mm i don't know i'm pretty content with everything right now i don't know about extreme happiness every day is just the same day seems like uh dunking across the street at the clippers center there's a basketball court there and uh i've been working on it for a while and i finally got up <laugher> yeah mm i have four close friends that i've known for over uh eight years uh each and i don't know studious hardworking determined mm i don't know <laughter> yeah <laughter> mm probably my metabolism which i don't really have control over is uh i don't know i'm pretty content with myself hmm <sigh> i think in uh my sixth grade year of uh uh grade school i was uh i wasn't the best of students but i had a teacher who was diligent and like he failed me through the whole year but i i learned a lot and uh i developed a passion for school afterwards so it was like a situation i overcome after feeling so bad and down uh the same teacher who made me feel really bad actually because if it wasn't for his like sterness i don't think i would've getting the discipline to be where i am at now in college and stuff so he's been pretty influential uh i remember this time i was in the desert or uh uh up in joshua tree with my best friend and his dad and we actually got stuck in the mountains and like we went down a gully and then his jeep wouldn't get over a rock so it was it was pretty yeah it was it was um <tisk> it was kinda weird i i thought i was superman i tried to move a rock that was thousands of pounds didn't work but yeah we eventually got out we thought we were gonna be stuck in the desert but it was a fun time i got to drive in the desert when i didn't have my license so it was fun yeah about that day or in general mm other than like the u_c thing like where i didn't apply to the schools in time i regret that yeah hm i don't know i was i was ten years old ten years ago <laughter> uh i'd probably say to myself uh <sigh> i i have no clue that's that's an interesting question uh being the first from my immediate college <coll> uh immediate family as in my mother my brothers and my sister to go to college so yes it's it's pretty in yeah no problem 
<sync> yes doing pretty good oh i was born in uh brooklyn new york i came out here when i was seven and i've been here ever since uh i don't consider myself anything but a californian <laughter> uh i'm a welder um i just i don't know something about it making and um building things and repairing things that intrigued me and uh uh i was actually pretty good at it so i stuck with it and and that's my profession <sigh> gee i really never had that i've just uh <sigh> kind of always uh hoped that i would have a job that could support myself and my family and uh i was satisfied with that well uh i just recently lost my uncle and uh he raised me since i was seven years old and uh other than my wife i don't have any more family um he passed away last uh july and uh i'm starting to get over it um i knew the day would come but he was my last living relative so i've been depressed about that and uh uh but i'm doing better it depends on the atmosphere um if i'm around people that i don't feel comfortable with i'm kinda reserved but uh if i'm comfortable and uh i feel like i fit in well i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> right i enjoy old movies uh old uh well it's called film noir and uh i love those old black and white movies and i get on netflix or amazon and i try to pick a movie that's uh from back then people were different than they uh i don't know it's just a different era and i enjoy it <sigh> well my wife says uh i probably not as good as i think i do but uh i've got to admit sometimes i lose my temper and it is according to her over things that i shouldn't be losing my temper about but um i'm working on it and uh i have basically had this problem ever since i was a young child oh yes <laughter> uh i've uh been in and out of trouble with the law when i was much younger i'm i'm passed that point now but uh <sigh> you know when you're young you think you know everything and uh you know you're never gonna get old and the future doesn't matter but uh it does matter because everthing that you do when you're young uh follows you for the rest of your life and i don't regret things that i've done but if i could go back i definitely would make different choices uh me and my wife we we <w> we don't argue we <sigh> disagree and it's she's very strong willed and she's a match for me <laughter> so uh we go back and forth but you know we don't get violent and we don't uh uh say meanful things or hurt each other we're just she is a determined strong willed woman and <sniff> i am who i am so we kinda go back and forth and lately i have been the one to <sigh> bow down and be the one to lower the threshold of the argument because uh in the long run it's just her and me and there's nobody else more important to me um <sigh> <tisk> when i was younger i wish that uh i didn't follow some of the people that i followed and what i mean by that is you know running in a circle with certain people and having an ego bigger than my common sense and um that's what got me into trouble <sniff> i was an only child and uh i kind of enjoyed being the center of attention and um getting the girls to laugh or having people mm think i was you know cool or whatever you wouldn't think that now i'm kinda overweight and balding but when i was in my twenties i was a a completely different person and <sniff> if i would've had some brothers and sisters i may not have thought or acted that way but i was an only child so i you know ran where people thought i was cool and that got me into trouble hardest decision i ever had to make was giving the authorization to um have my uncle pass away he was on life support and his kidneys had failed <sigh> and um doctors said there was nothing more he could do and to not have him <sigh> go through any suffering to let him slip away and as you can see i get very upset my uncle raised me like his own son and never let me down <sniff> and he's gone and for lack of a better word to push the button i never thought i would have to do that <sniff> but as i said i'm getting over it and um things are getting better slowly my wife she is uh always there for me <sniff> she will <laughter> always surprise me we she's not my wife she's my best friend <sniff> and she <laughter> knows me better than i know myself um <coughs> we enjoy uh uh doing simple things it's not that we can't do other things if we wanted to but we <sniff> mesh um <sniff> we enjoy each other's company uh we like the same things and uh we you know occasionally go out and do something together but we <clears throat> we just enjoy each other's company and she like i say knows me better than anybody and um it surprises me sometimes mhm you know <sigh> lately well i can't say lately <sniff> if i don't <coughs> excuse me if i don't do a rigorous activity or something that really uh stresses me or strains my body it it let's say for a couple of days i'm just very relaxed and you know not doing much i i just automatically get up after four and a half five hours i mean and you know my wife will say you know guy you're not getting any sleep but i mean i don't feel tired i don't feel exhausted i don't feel like i need to go back to sleep i'll stay up all day and i'm fine and most people would say that's not enough sleep but you know for me i'm it doesn't affect me <sniff> well i wish some things could be different but uh i'm not dissatisfied <sniff> um uh i'm happy with my life uh there there uh like with anybody else there's a few things that i wish were different and i think that's in anybody everybody else's uh you know life but um <sniff> i'm i'm i'm i'm i'm content yeah i feel a little less motivated <sniff> um recently well i can't say recently this was back in january um my wife and a few uh friends were noticing that i was um becoming forgetful and i i couldn't remember things i i didn't see it and um you know when they when everybody brought it to my attention then i started to but anyway i went to the doctor and um they gave me the tests and apparently i have m_c_i which is mild cognitive impairment and uh i've over the last month or so nobody has mentioned it to me i mean maybe i'm getting better but the neurologist that i saw <sss> is having me come back in a year and gonna retest me um hopefully it's not the beginning stages of alzheimer's i'm still a little young for that i'm only fifty <fif> fifty two but um i was diagnosed with uh mild cognitive impairment and uh it it could've been due also i was told by him uh because of the death of my uncle i could've been pretty depressed i was not able to retain things and so well i'm going back in a year and we'll see if uh i'm any better i'm sorry i'm not understanding you i'm sorry how <h no no i have not yes two thousand one um i was in a um uh what is the word i'm looking for <sniff> i was in a um in a state of mind of of where i was just going to get myself in trouble and and not benefit anything if i didn't seek any help um i was diagnosed with uh depression and anxiety disorder uh worrying and thinking too much about things and uh thinking the worst and uh i i take medication for that uh well <w> well you know it's not really therapy it's <clears throat> you know every uh few months you know you gotta see the doctor are you doing fine everything good and you know they just refill your prescription <laughter> it's you know it it's you know kinda like the next person next person it it's i i'm with kaiser so it's it's they'll talk to you but it they give you the impression that um you know i i okay let's move along you know they they'll <th> they'll hear your explanation but you know it it they don't have all the time for you that you may want so i i i i'm doing fine now if i really needed help i would i would do something the medication works for me <sigh> last time i felt real happy well it would depend on what the event is i'm always happy when i'm doing something with me and my wife and we're enjoying each other and i you know i'm not trying to sound like she's my whole world and i don't have anything else she is my world but um i i i enjoy being with her and we're we we do things together and <sniff> i i i'm happy all the time when when we're doing that um <sniff> when i'm outside of that circle i i i don't know if this sounds right but i'm not seeking happiness i i can only explain it as i'm content i'm not um i i'm not disappointed or i'm not uh wanting anything i'm you know whatever comes my way is fine so well um <sniff> i don't know i i couldn't give you that answer <laughter> um <sniff> well my best friend is my wife but uh <sniff> she would um describe me as uh i don't think before i speak um i um let the littlest insignificant things bother me and i get angry over but the big things it's like i let it go and she's bewildered by that <coughs> um uh <vocal fry> years and years ago um she i had a uh classic uh pontiac lemans and she had gotten into a minor fender bender and she thought it was gonna be the end of the world 'cause that was my baby and i <sigh> you know hey don't worry we'll get it fixed and she was <w> she thought <laughter> that i was gonna hang her or something you know because that was my this was you know that was my baby and uh she goes you know you you get excited over nothing but you know i something like wrecking your car that you love and you've put so many hours of work into it and money you know it gets crashed and it's like you don't care so that's the only way i can explain it well i i need to lose some weight as you can see <laughter> i'm definitely uh been on an eating binge uh and uh the neurologist said that's probably due to the event with my uncle um i'm heavy <heav> i am this is the heaviest i've ever been in my life and i'm finding it a little bit harder um i i can't say harder but i'm i'm finding the will power to say no and to stick with it and to go exercise or you know not you know  movement now going maybe for a walk you know me and my wife when we were a little bit younger we used to love going for walks <clears throat> and we lived in a scrubbed_entry uh boy you know look at that wonder what's inside there you know that that's uh we don't do that no more i guess it's we're a little bit older now and <laughter> a little bit heavier it's harder to walk with all this weight <laughter> but i i i i wish i could change that because uh i i you know it's just not healthy the size <sigh> <sigh> uh lately no i don't regret anything lately um <sniff> everything's been fine the like i say the the biggest biggest impact in my life was the event with my uncle and uh i never ever in a hundred years or ever thought that i would face that situation and <sniff> i'll never forget it but they say time heals all wounds and and it does <laughter> don't listen to other people uh again i'm not trying to bring up my uncle just because of what has happened but he used to constantly tell me to uh he would see the things that i was doing and the paths that i was going down and i constantly thought i knew better and i think a lot of youngsters think that anyway they um the young lady that i was talking to in here they think they're invincible and so did i <laughter> i figured ah i'm never gonna i'm never gonna have those problems um i wish i could've changed some things um <coughs> the history of my past follows me as it does everybody and that has limited me in in a lot of opportunities and a lot of things that i'm able to do uh i don't miss them but if i could go back uh ten or twenty years i definitely wouldn't make some of the decisions that i made my welding certificates um i'm uh certified by the american welding society and i've uh <sniff> uh that's probably the biggest achievement that i've made for you know myself an accomplishment um <clears throat> uh people that i know say that i'm uh well i haven't been working on cars lately but they said that i have a natural knack for uh restoration and working on vehicles and i don't see it but i've been told that once or twice but i i've kind of i i've kind of started to slip away from that i don't i can't say it's from lack of interest but i just don't feel the motivation no more i wish i had a pocket of money and i'd have somebody else to it that's how i feel <laughter> okay well thank you bye bye 
<synch> okay yes i am i'm good thank you <laughter> originally from los angeles and my parents are from central america yes the weather um i like that i can get to the water if i want to uh to the hills or hike or just any element that i wanna get to i can get to traffic <laughter> busyness everybody's always in a hurry um um that's about it <laughter> when i can i have family in central america and when i can my husband and i we try to go to warm places like mexico or somewhere on the caribbean the freedom of not having to have my daily routine and not be guilty about not doing something i said i would do if i'm at home and if i'm too far away from home to do it then i don't have anything to worry about <laughter> um recently i went to honduras again that's where my family's from so it was sort of like a it's it's a dual fold i get to see my family but i also kinda get to be away from home so i do it by not imposing on them i visit them but i stay in a hotel so that way i can still kinda have my freedom and not feel like i'm obligated to being with them so it's more fun that way experiences on vacation or um most memorable experience probably hawaii in lahaina and just having i love food i'm a foodie so having the pig roasted underground and just eating it that way it just i've never been able to taste it that way any time else so it's like a very memory it's a deep memory for me 'cause no matter what i do to my pork it'll never taste like that pork in lahaina <laughter> business and that was years ago so i ended up in the marketing field so i've enjoyed i my business background did help me in the marketing field my dream job hmm well i guess it would have to do with food i love to cook and the only reason i hesitate is because i love to cook but i just do it for home and friends and family if it were to turn into in if it were to turn into a job i feel as if it would just not be as joyous or i wouldn't have as much fun as i do have it you know as i have now but if i could just do it as a job and still have the fun and the joy that i have in cooking every day now then that would be my dream job i'm outgoing <laughter> <laughter> that's cool <laughter> uh depends on where i'm at if i'm wherever i'm at actually the first thing i do is just kinda get a hold of myself that way i'm always in control no matter where i'm standing at and always say that i am my own peace p a p e a c e so i just kinda just take a deep breath assess my situation figure out what i can control what i can't control and then proceed from there but just sort of just kinda <deep breath> <sigh> breathe and get a hold of myself first i'm actually very good i'm actually very mild-tempered to begin with um i don't really let anything agitate me and so if i do feel myself just getting hot or if i just react i just sort of just like i said i just do my own little self check you know eh i might've cussed i might've went off for a second but i do my own little self check and just say you know what come on no this is mm it's not worth it this person's not worth it the situation is not worth it be who you are and just stay there actually it was with my husband and we were going back and forth about my relationship with my father and i was trying to get a point across to him and he was just kinda overlooking my feelings in it and i was i didn't want him to overlook my feelings and act as if i wasn't feeling the way i was feeling so i kept stressing my point in different ways and then i found myself now in a debate and then that's when i pulled back and said no look babe this is how i feel about it i'm not asking you to make me feel any differently i'm just asking you to acknowledge my feelings when i got to my own conclusion i felt triumphant because the point of the argument in my mind was to clarify how i felt not for him to impose his you know he's very a macho kinda manly guy i didn't want him to just overshadow my feelings with his logic and so i said no as long as i i felt better because i he i felt undestood and i felt heard hmm <sigh> let's see i can my son comes to mind he's twenty two years old and he we have a very estranged relationship right now and it's okay i'm okay with it he's used to be being a little bit more needy so he i think he assumed that i would just always look xxx go looking for him or call for him as opposed to waiting him to call me and i think it may be a very weird answer but i wish early on in my life as his mother i would've kind of adjusted that so that he wouldn't be so comfortable waiting for me to be the one to come and check on him he doesn't live with me he has his own place but waiting for me to be the one to come and look for him and you know try to make sure that he's okay i think this is probably way more <laughter> ethereal than you meant but i would've i would've done that differently i would've mothered him differently along the way and released him at an earlier age meaning that i would've treated him more of an adult and then also not expected him to just kinda you know i would've killed the expectation in him for me to contour to him if that makes sense woo <laughter> no it's not easy you have to sacrifice and beyond just physical things you have to just make sure you put your kid's needs ahead of your own and i guess the second part of that answer is that it is easy once you realize that as long as they're okay you're okay so it my my son my daughter they both know i love them unconditionally so my parenting has become easier the more and more i've lived in that truth where i'm not expecting anything from them but then also not expecting any disrespect so as long as we have that clear line of communication whatever else is going on falls under that category of respect seeing them maybe make decisions that i wish they wouldn't make uh it could be as simple as an outfit <laughter> you know choice or as much as a career change but um having to sit back watch them listen be open and then just kinda just be there you know if they wanna talk about it but then not also also trying not to manage them because i was also their age and i have to remember that i i didn't wanna be managed and even if i made a mistake i didn't wanna be judged so the difficult part is just watching them go through the process on their own and just sort of kinda just waiting around and luckily it's nothing major with my kids but whatever that personal downfall is just kinda being there and not having an i told you i told you so um spirit on me it's fulfilling knowing that you know i created this you know i planned both my kids so it's just it's a real it's an honor that i was able to do it it's an honor that they're healthy um and it's fun watching them sort of just kind of grow into their own and it's like they're mini me's but then they're also different than i am and so it's fun just being able to allow them uh be who they are and just celebrate them as they are so i'm enjoying that wow completely my parents immigrated here from central america in the sixties um i was born the year after they got here so their their mentality was different they wanted to come and get the american lifestyle eh which was not a bad thing it's just that their parenting style was more about um making sure we had a home making sure uh we had the shelter of course and food and clothes and schooling but there was not really a lot of time spent on the relationship from my mother to daughter to me as a daughter or my father to me as a daughter so i had to kinda figure it out on my own when it came to being a parent divorcing my first husband um 'cause i was gonna be the one that toppled that whole situation um he was a good father just not a good husband to me and after twenty years i knew that i was gonna be the one to say this is not working for me anymore and since i did that the domino effect has <ha> was is this is not virtual it happened <laughter> we ended up selling our house you know dividing up the assets and then living separately and then my kids were kind of in between for a little while um and then i just made some decisions to where i didn't wanna go through so much court hassle so i just did a tina turner and said just give me my name you keep everything else so it was just a very hard decision by way of how it affected my kids that's all i cared about in terms of losing everything physical and and all the material stuff i could care less but it was hard because i i knew it was gonna affect my kids and they were the only thing i was concerned about uh my husband and i did not you know see eye to eye on certain things xxx regarding our marriage he i didn't feel validated as a woman or as a wife and that's just who i am and those were the very areas that he didn't validate me in he just kinda saw me as a partner who was helping fund his extracurriculars whether it was just travel or or whatever the case may be i'm not i'm not here to talk about that part of it bottom line is that whatever he was doing was outside of you know the sanctity of our home and i was tired of just you know working and and and him benefiting from everything but then not being fulfilled as a woman or a wife and he wasn't prepared to change xxx despite all the counseling we went through and i thought well this is not working for me and i have to take care of myself first and i i had low self-esteem i you know i wasn't perfect i had a lot of things going on with myself and i had to learn how to love myself in order to uh in order for me to love my children and then in order for me to get the love that i should get in return <laughter> you know what it's actually pretty easy because at the end of the day i just you know good bad ugly or indifferent whatever mistakes i made that day or whatever great thing went on that day my goal in life is just to have peace of mind so when i put my head down at night i i just i ask myself did you know did i do anything that i'm ashamed of today did i cross anybody did i not do you know and i'm not being sanctimonious or acting as if i'm pollyanna but i believe in karma i'm a god-fearing woman so i just wanna make sure that i did everything i was supposed to do today and if there's something that i can rectify you know i just make it a point to promise to myself to go back and rectify it or at least learn from that and just not make that same mistake in another day really good light um you know had some rough patches with the family individually like i said with my son my daughter's a teenager so she's kinda coming into her own so that's a different relationship she's opposite of me i'm i'm actually very easygoing very bohemian style she's very social very you know just out there so i'm having to just kinda find our balance but overall it's just i i won't complain i'm very happy for a very simplistic lifestyle that i just kinda foster on my own every day and i just enjoy my little mini accomplishments whether anyone sees them or not <laughter> no i haven't thank god no really happy let's see uh it's at home and i think it was when wow <mumbling> different things running through my head um i think when my daughter and i my teenage daughter and i came to understanding <underst> eh understanding on our mother daughter relationship i'm not trying to be her best friend but yet that doesn't mean she can't talk to me and i think when she came to me the other day and just kinda gave me a big hug from behind me without really saying anything i really felt her just accepting herself and she accepted the fact that i accept who she is as she is so it was a very tame moment only she and i kinda knew about it but it just it gave just a happiness that nothing else could ever give me <laughter> thank you um <laughter> i'm easygoing i'm fun i'm just very you know um eh chameleon comes to mind i just kinda acclimate to what whatever situation i'm in i'm very honest i'm very real and just you know bold if i have to be um i'm just very adult i'm an adult woman and you know they would just decribe <descr> or my best friend would describe me as someone that she can rely on extremely reliable i do as i say i say what i do and i just you know i don't i don't deal with b s <laughter> hmm what could i change about myself uh probably cosmetic things maybe i would just uh that's not even true let me think what what what are some things i would change about myself um sounds weird that i would say not much <m> nothing really um i think i would just be a little bit more aware of others i think i'm a i'm super sensitive to others but i think i would just be more aware make sure that i'm not being selfish or i'm not tuning anyone out just because i wanna get through my yoga or i wanna do something else i think i would just be more um observant and aware of those around me to make sure i'm not offending anybody i don't have any regrets i i think about that all the time and you know it's it's natural to go back and say if i were in that situation with the mindset i have now what would i do eh but the reality is that i know that everything that has happened up to this point has shaped me so i can't you know very well take the benefit from it and then turn around and call it a regret because i know i learned from it um probably sounds very textbook but that's true that's just really how i live so i believe that everything good bad ugly or indifferent happened for a reason i truly believe that and my job is to take from it what i'm supposed to take from it and take that into my future so i'm to take the you know the hard knocks with the with the joys hmm be real with myself that's that's one thing that took me twenty years to kinda get to um just to kinda be honest with myself to embrace who i am to just you know get to know who i am uh learn my own infrastructure be comfortable with the uh with the innate things that are a part of me don't try to revamp <re> don't try to revamp myself or try to become something that i'm not uh i would've still chosen the same marketing career to still i would've still climbed the same corporate ladders but i would've done it from a more internal place um not that i lost myself in it but when in terms of my family life i would've just been more true to myself and that way i wouldn't have had any kind of resentments my family my uh my role as a wife my role as a mother i think that ultimately that's where my main fulfillment comes from because no matter what at the end of this life's this life uh this body uh in this leased vehicle that i'm in um all i'm gonna do or all i'm gonna be is an epitaph <laughter> somewhere in a cementary scrubbed_entry and i'm always just true to that i mean i i've been always true to that from the time i was eighteen and realized i wanted to be married and have a family and kids and all that i think that ultimately that that's where my true fulfillment comes from <laughter> cool thank you bye 
<synch> yes great and yourself houston texas when i was very young every few years it's a little bit slower my parents brought me as a child the weather um there's disconnect at times um people are just kind of you know some people are warm and friendly and other people aren't it's kind of interesting yes mm different people cultures experiences um pick a place um greece the west indies uh west indies very laid back very relaxed um kind of easy flowing great weather great water very nice greece um lots of culture lots of um the past very interesting um birth of children um i have a six-year-old and we have a set of twins boys all boys mm not always challenging sometimes um i think you know the kids are different they have different needs you know mm loving lots of unconditional love um i think i travel along the same lines um i give my children lots of choices and i have lots let them have input on what happens psychology um was gonna go down another path i was gonna work with the youth in the system um for children no <laughter> um dream job i don't know if my dream job is an actual job there are lots of um there's xxx lots of things that i'd like to do um uh from a philanthropist point of view i'd like to do that would be my dream job um mostly serving children that are undeserved <un> undeserved <unde> in undeserved areas um giving um giving some outlets and different things that can improve their life difficult difficult monies are aren't always there uh it's not always easy to go in underserved areas um with new ideas it's difficult and i don't have the flexibility just to spend all my time doing that so outgoing just not shy just have one of those kinda personalities very outspoken um hang out in the backyard lie on the hammock read pretty good um my sister on saturday oh what was it about um about i don't know silly about parking cars in a certain a place frustrated hmm um i probably could've handled that situation a little bit differently could've been a little bit more giving <givi> could've been a little bit more giving i guess not so stubborn um hardest decision hmm hardest decision i think the hardest decision i've had to make of recent would um be turning off life support system to an uncle mm thank you <y> mm there was nothing else that could be done for him uh an accident that i had a car accident i have very little memory of it but it's still a car accident um i was hit broadside by another vehicle going about forty miles per hour flipped over my truck had to be cut out with the jaws of life it was xxx very difficult time it's good we're happy very close yeah my mother my parents older sibling my parents older sibling just always there standing in the gap available for conversation we'll talk things through pretty easy irritable <laughter> pretty good pretty great um not really i think i'm getting up there in age so you know with a woman and perimenopausal stuff that's part of the sleep deprivation thing i think no no this morning i feel happy now loving compassionate um strong-willed determined um little bit more patience sometimes i wouldn't say trouble no um really badly about myself um a fight with my best friend about eight months ago saddened because i love her and i don't like to fight with her probably so could've been a little more understanding could not have spoken my mind about that situation um yeah i have regret um about that situation or just in general um to be always open very open-minded um went to disneyland with the children for the weekend good thing um music kids family friends um kids you're welcome buh bye 
<synch> yes very well uh ohio mhm uh finished school and came out to start my life uh not often now not really often uh because my parents have both passed away and so that's my reason for that was my reason for going home prior uh there's really not a comparison you know this is warm and sunny and that has four seasons so it's a very different environment i it took a minute to get adjusted to the different culture but uh after i was adjusted you know the sunshine keeps you here uh i love the weather i love the fact that i have the ocean and the mountains and um so many things that i can choose from and the diversity that i find here uh i tend to not have things that i don't like uh because where i am i know that i'm finding myself there so and i like me so that means that there's really nothing i don't like yes i do uh i love being able to explore different cultures be able to meet different people have a different set of experiences and at the same time to be able to find the commonality between uh all types of people it's a very rich experience um which one to where uh i guess i'm thinking about egypt and the wonderful experiences that i have there uh as i go the people and the warm and loving experience i have the knowledge i get to pursue through the exploring the temples and the pyramids etcetera things like that there are so many there really are but i can think of uh seeing a baby in a mosque which was just really pure and it really stayed with me how similar we actually all are um that's probably one of the things that i remember most from one of my very first trips uh there and let's see just the interaction of the people the food you know incredible i love the food too wow i've studied lots of different things i've studied law i've studied um entertainment i've studied communications i've studied whatever i want to quite a renaissance woman <laughter> <laughter> ah it's just always been my way to really explore all of the things that i enjoy keeps me fresh keeps me happy keeps me alive and um just allows me to be able to be fully developed as a human being being able to do that mhm um i don't have a dream job per se what i do have is a um desire to just be able to be free to do whatever it is that i choose on a daily basis so uh probably more outgoing mhm <laughter> well i start my day out very relaxed because i start my day with meditation uh and several <s> uh several other spiritual practices that i perform before i move uh around i get exercise so that uh i keep everything humming everything moving and uh then move forward from there uh excellent <laughter> i don't really have one anymore argued um cannot remember the last time that i actually had an argument um don't know what it's about i imagine that the last time i argued about something probably might be related to money situation i wish i had handled differently you know i try to take each experience as they come and try not to have regrets to hold guilt about the way anything uh went because they're all for me very positive learning experiences uh that i get to explore who i am through so i don't really see them as needing them to be different i need to learn from them or to um just really accept what is mhm hardest decision i've ever had to make um don't really have a quote on quote hard decision you know because i grew up in a way uh where my mother was extremely wonderful in the way that she always taught me to know that it was my own life and so she would never make decisions for me she always taught me to say she would always say it's your life and so um for me decisions don't really come as difficult to make they're pretty easy to make because i've been making them since childhood so i don't really have a most difficult decision i've ever made mm event that i could erase from my memory i don't really have one that i can think of that would be so terrible that i would need to erase it again everything for me is a learning experience so there's nothing really to regret or erase uh very easy as soon as i hit the pillow i'm out uh great uh a little more uh physical exertion than normal  but uh still great <laughter> mm no not overall but again i attribute that and i accredit that to the spiritual practices that i perform on a daily basis that keep me pretty even tempered no mm no uh that's pretty much every day <laughter> i feel really happy every day i'm thankful i'm grateful for my life and uh i'm just thankful for everything that comes into it uh very smart uh very loving uh very intelligent funny uh outgoing that's probably probably what my friends would say uh there's really nothing that i think i need <laughter> to to do or to have or to be different uh about myself like i'm okay with everything the way it is really am <laughter> what advice would i have given myself ten or twenty years ago to know um to understand that everything that happened ten or twenty years ago was important in terms of developing the person that i am now and so to just be able to go with the flow and go with the experiences of life in order to be able to learn how to move effortlessly through any situation that comes up recently really enjoyed uh uh cooked a very wonderful meal um 'cause i love cooking so that was something i really enjoyed mhm wow my my willingness to get to know myself through travel through exploration through practices and through the practical application of everything that i've learned about people cultures places and most importantly you know the god within me bye 
<synch> yes i'm well thank you uh boston massachusetts yes i moved to l_a about a year after graduating college in two thousand and one uh quite often at least a couple times a year um god i love both cities they are polar opposite in many many ways but there's things about both of them that that i love uh to pursue acting and writing mm it's still not complete reality to me but it was actually very easy because of the um the the the creative factor out here allowed me to pursue what i wanted to creatively and it was different the social culture was different in a way where i from where i had grown up and it it suited me better my personality <sigh> oh god <go> i like the fact that you can come here and pursue any any niche of you know <kn> creativity or art or entertainment that you want to and sort of make your own path uh i grew up where it snows constantly and is very very cold so sounds obvious but clearly i like that it's you can swim year round and uh i like that it's there's always something to do no matter what day of the week it is what i don't like uh well i miss my family <fam> i miss that there's not <no> i don't like that there's not a big family element here i miss i'm a big family girl i miss my family i feel like it's very crowded here but yet it's very easy to feel eh sort of isolated alone here mhm mm i can't see your shoes but um i do mostly just not not too much worldly travel mostly back to boston and mm eh florida where my parents live but i do i enjoy traveling and take a lot of trips within california and around here oh just to have an adventure do something fun or if i'm going home it means i'm gonna see my family <clears throat> um one of my trips mm god well i like to drive up to northern california go to san francisco i have family and friends there always super super fun uh in god in college i with my college boyfriend when i was in boston i we drove we went to san francisco and drove down to l_a and las vegas and that was kind of how i realized i wanted to move here so that was very that was very that was a big one uh in general just <clears throat> mm memorable experiences i guess it would be moving here i moved to when i moved to l_a i got on a plane but didn't know anybody here and i just got i talked to a girl that i met online and agreed to be her roommate and she picked me up at the airport we never met and you know one of my dear friends to this day so definitely the the the flight out here was it was big monumental i felt powerful and excited and just open to whatever mhm studied communications um got a lots of every lot of different uh writing writing styles i eventually graduated with a a concentration in public relations and a english minor writing to pursue writing writer uh well i guess you could say writer slash actress which is um but i guess writing is first hard very hard because you need to no one's gonna push you to do it you have to be self-starter you have to make it happen so it's very hard 'cause i don't possess that naturally in my personality i do but not as much as i need to i would say outgoing on in general i <sigh> sometimes take a walk if i feel tense um listen ambient music helps if i need a soothing background white noise calming calming area and just just your basic deep breaths and just sort of take a minute to to come back to a calm neutral place i am getting better no <laughter> um i'm okay <ok> i'm good at controlling my temper 'cause i don't usually have a temper too often but when i do and i lose my cool i have a hard time controlling it yes no <laughter> hmm mm argued with someone um god i guess it was a friend a friend a girlfriend it it wasn't it was about uh our our each separate perspectives on a a certain situation between us that were obviously very very different um and it started out as something big and then we just realized this is this is stupid we don't need to be fighting about this so it kind of ended quickly <sigh> hmm mm i guess it would've been with uh an ex-boyfriend fighting with an ex-boyfriend relationship stuff definitely losing my temper and making a situation escalated in a way that it didn't need to be i wish that i had just walked away from it mm i don't know if i could've avoided the complete situation but i definitely could've made the outcome much less chaotic hmm uh i guess that would be hmm walking away from somebody who was definitely bad toxic from my life uh but that i really did want in my life and it was a true wrestling with morality and kind of sort of growing up like coming to a point where i have to say i'm gonna have to do something that's really really hard for sort of you know short-term pain for long-term gain and i had to make sort of an adult decision relationship-wise but it was still carried over into other areas of my life and taught me that you know you're not always gonna feel great <gr> every decision's not always gonna be easy and feel good yes i was kinda forced to this issue just what was going on in life was sort of you can't ignore those signs just yeah mm i guess it would be a particular argument i had with somebody um that happened to be in sort of a public place and i got in trouble for it i wish i could erase that my relationship with my family <fam> i have a wonderful family i'm completely blessed amazing parents i have a brother and has he has a little girl so i have a baby niece that i love more than anything in the world and i could not ask for a better family they're the ideal my parents for sure they're just wonderful people that just taught by example and i feel like i'm a good mix of both of them it's pretty easy i try um lately it's been a little bit hard my sleep's been off but for the most part i've come to recognize the importance of it and it's it's been pretty easy <sigh> uh a little edgy or fidgety maybe a little bit out of it i might um might seem like i'm in a good mood 'cause i might be a little giddy and uh laughing more just sort of <laughter> high emotions but overall get um irritated faster and just um sweat more just feel feel um just a little off i've been feeling pretty good lately mm not really just trying to be more focused <clears throat> get things done um just trying to focus on what i wanna do career-wise and really stop wasting time or you know just procrastinating and and get things done and being inspired going and seeing you know being around people that are doing what i wanna do and just carrying it over to my own life no no uh oh just a couple days i was just in with my family and my baby niece in florida and that's why i went down there to see her so it was just awesome i'm always happy when i see her probably as um  very funny humor would definitely probably be one of the first things they would say joking always a little wise-ass in my personality but um they would describe me as always uh unconditional there for them and just they know they know that i'm there if they need them always my drive being more driven and just getting things done mm i guess it would be well a recent a recent ex-boyfriend that was a a mistake of a relationship uh yeah sort of just uh i i think because he the way he felt about himself certain things he would say and even though what he said didn't directly make me feel bad the whole situation made me realize wow the fact that i'm even with this person made me feel like i'm let allowing people into my life that shouldn't be there so i'm dumbing myself down and that yeah it was terrible yes i regret not listening to my gut instincts don't second-guess yourself <sigh> <clears throat> um great listener constant sense of humor uh very malleable in terms of eh people uh tolerant and comfortable around all just people from just all ages race gender whatever i just i crave diversity and love to just you know i just i i i'm people person and i um i start every day with a blank slate i um i did some acting work on a on a series with a really great group of people and it was it was a very cool cool creative experience very inspiring probably coming out to l_a on my own without knowing anybody and staying here and pursuing what i wanna do thank you goodbye 
<synch> yes spectacular this is an interesting experiment <laughter> uh i'm from middle of nowhere iowa <sigh> uh may second of two thousand seven so exactly five years six years ago um infrequently like once every couple years uh the weather exists so it's more extreme and then  it's rather less exciting a lot less colorful uh winter in minnesota <laughter> uh it took approximately the drive in that's that's about all it took the lights uh the lights took care of the rest uh i really love that it's a giant concrete playground at nighttime so that bycicles uh have free rein of the streets i like all the art i love the fact that there's so many different kinds of culture jammed all together and that if you look hard enough you can find anything you really want here oh you know the traffic <sigh> the exceedingly high cost of living uh yeah those are those are my big beefs uh not nearly as much as i would like to i've done a little bit uh i like not knowing exactly how things are gonna go i like the fact that it forces me to uh deal with people to deal with situations in ways that i normally wouldn't have to uh last year i got to hang out in san marcos for a little bit after i split up with my ex and then after san marcos i went back to iowa for a bunch of family stuff and then i brought my little brother to los angeles <laughter> uh last week managed to go on a bike ride for cyclavia scrubbed_entry as a <laughter> he was basically a rolling green light the entire way down venice boulevard and so he made he made a bunch of like national news and he was all over the place but the rest of us as his support group riding around on tall bikes and stuff the we didn't bat an eye we didn't blink because this is this is normal for our friends that wasn't even the most absurd thing he's done lately that was just a a happy normal sunday but our group of friends is so unusual that a normal sunday for us is extreme for everyone else <laughter> i used to be an introvert but definitely an extrovert the last few years thank you los angeles um <clears throat> once i found the right group of friends it was easy to be social it it drew me to be social extroverted even outgoing bombastic for the first time and it stuck um if i weren't already the most relaxed guy already i would probably do things but when i'm really stressed out i i do all sorts of stuff it um usually i try to enlist my friends to help me do an art project uh what temper <laughter> uh scrubbed_entry um <laughter> panicked 'cause i really wanted to make him not hate me and i mostly failed uh hard on him i mostly uh mostly got by with a couple of scrapes on my ego uh when  when that all went down i tried to to talk to him but i got distracted for the very first time that day and so instead of having my <sigh> verbal gloves up i managed to take a whole bunch of words to the side of the head and fall over a trash can it was not my most graceful moment uh i feel guilty about lots of stuff um i feel guilty about eating more often than anything else 'cause i really love junk food it's really good i have very little food willpower 'cause i used to be a fat guy i'm not sure what the hardest decision i ever had to make was uh made a lot of hard decisions i guess <sigh> it was pretty hard to leave los angeles after my ex and my best friend did a whole bunch of nasty stuff but it wasn't even that hard 'cause it pushed me to do it so it's a tricky question madam uh oh you know broken collarbone severe pain get surgery on it it all seemed like it made sense at the time <laughter> mm no my memories are important i have lived a spoiled blessed life and if i changed anything then it wouldn't be the same universe i like this universe <laughter> uh my little brother lives here he's awesome he's actually right outside waiting for me uh my mom is crazy my dad is crazy everyone else is crazy i'm pretty crazy uh but since most of the rest of them live so far away don't really have to deal with them too much relationship is positive and sparce uh jackrabbit's been a pretty positive influence on me lately she is a magical creature uh well there's the part where she's intensely physically beautiful there's the part where she manages to hit me with the best inspiration words there's the part where she actually works on the exact things that make me excited there's the part where she pops in and out of my life at the exact right instance and then there's the part where she is a hundred percent kind and caring all the time all of those things are really nice but then when you add to that and compound it with the fact that she does this all without wanting anything in return i don't know that's <sigh> smitten <laughter> uh <laughter> what a funny question how do i know them as though she's multiple people how did you know uh i know her through my bicycle friends <sigh> uh the hard part is going to bed but as soon as i get to to sleepland i'm pretty much there until an earthquake uh hits so i i get to sleep poorly but then i'm a pro at it so it doesn't matter <deep breath> less verbose and that's about it my dark circles get slightly larger and i'm pretty much the exact same dude because i've been doing it most of my life uh so stoked that i might as well be on fire um mm because the universe in its infinite uh i suppose the word is sardonic sense of humor uh has managed to convince me of the reality of magic in the arthur c clark sense uh so as a fortunate and <cough> vaguely aware being eh it's my privilege to get to enjoy more time like this uh yeah uh my excitement is increasing at an almost exponential rate and i'm feeling more and more inspired all the time if i could just work on the motivation i'd be set mm not since you asked me on the form a little while ago no uh no i used to think i had it but who knows at this point that was awhile ago uh i was very unhappy with most of my life for a very long time and then i moved to los angeles and started having fun mm and then that's uh yeah the rest is ancient history um twenty thirteen <laughter> uh <sigh> working on my shoes this morning was really nice doodling uh an art project that all my friends helped and put on that's that was really nice it's a nice feeling <laughter> <sigh> that's a very good question i'm not actually sure i'll ask him later today though um i guess i'm enthusiastic i am thesauric and i am <sigh> i'm gonna have to say highly analytical <laughter> uh it'd be nice if i could get my super powers back that'd be pretty cool uh like turning on some of the fancier finely tuned and delicate machinery that chinese medicine has clued me into inside myself <laughter> uh that's a really tough one i think the thing that i'm most proud of would probably be <sigh> you know i'm not actually sure <laughter> oh all sorts of stuff but i'm working on that <clears throat> <deep breath> don't masturbate so much <laughter> uh jackrabbit really bad puns uh and dessert <laughter> no problem bye ellie 
<synch> hello yeah i'm alright a little tired uh i live in culver city um but originally i i was i grew up in venice um the beach fast drivers um the city i've lived in utah i don't really like anything else but the city um i don't know many people who live here anymore uh traffic it's too big but it's home <laughter> uh i've been out of the country a few times uh seeing new <n> <clears throat> seeing new places when i was fourteen i went to costa rica to visit my father and i was there for two weeks and that was the last time i've been there in costa rica um seeing my father for the first time in a few years was definitely a shocker um joy i was happy excited kinda scared it wasn't my decision it was my mom's she'd planned the trip yeah uh i wanted to be an art major but i didn't understand why i was in math classes among other classes and i thought i was wasting my time so i decided i really didn't wanna do that so i moved back to l_a i don't really have a dream job uh i would like to be self-employed though right now i'm thinking about going to school to become a personal trainer but i'm not really sure uh around new people i'm very reserved but the people i do know i'm a lot more outgoing and talkative <laughter> um to relax i go on walks i walk my dog a lot um i call my girlfriend if i wanna calm down i also do uh meditation and self-hypnosis i try it depends on what <wha> how i'm feeling or how upset i am or how calm i'm trying to be if i'm really upset it's a lot harder for me to calm down and bring myself down through meditation or through self-hypnosis but yeah um i'm alright at it sometimes i lose it i yell when i lose my temper and i have put holes in walls not yet <sigh> last night me and my mom got in an argument it was about me buying a ticket last night for a greyhound to go to utah i'm going up there to work for a few weeks and make a little bit of money and i needed to buy my ticket a week in advance and i didn't want to do it last night that situation last night i wish i had not blown up or gotten as raged enraged as i can over the situation 'cause it escalated my little sister i'm very close with um she's fifteen years old she's about to turn sixteen in a few days uh i would do anything for her she is the world to me my mom um we fight we push each other's buttons i believe she views me as my father she believes that i will not succeed at anything sad it's okay um i wish i could forget most of my high school years or my sophomore year uh i just didn't like high school or my sophomore year i uh getting sober and going uh into to a drug rehab um when i was sixteen i got um <sigh> i just started doing a a few different drugs and it got out of hand i guess and my mom was trying to get me help and i didn't want the help so i kept uh escaping to different places and running away and not wanting to be in the places so i finally agreed to go to utah and try and get sober scrubbed_entry um he's my best friend my entire life ever since i can remember and we we grew up together he used to use drugs with me and he's been sober for more than a year now almost impossible um i either have to have no sleep the night before to get a few hours or i i just i don't i don't sleep well i'm against taking pills and i stopped smoking marijuana and so now i just i don't sleep or haven't been the past few weeks yeah it's not fun i lay in bed until i finally fall asleep in the early morning or i watch t_v until late at night or netflix i'm out of it i'm tired i'm groggy i'm a lot more likely to my anger is a lot more likely to come out i've been alright this weekend is been better than most my girlfriend has stayed at my place the entire weekend so i've been happy um <deep breath> <sigh> i don't i'm not as irritable no but yes i was probably i was i believe i was twelve the first time i was diagnosed i've been diagnosed multiple times though um most recent time being less than a year ago uh my mom sought help for me she saw that i was unhappy and she became worried no uh i stopped in on june first when i graduated my uh drug rehab program in utah of last year i'm learned coping skills so i'm able to calm myself down when i'm angry easier i i i know how to stay away from the my trigger points and getting away from staying away from being angry or becoming depressed it can be if the person's willing to change and wanting it two days ago it was because i was with my girlfriend we were having a moment and so i was just overwhelmed by the happiness i guess <laughter> trustworthy um funny shit i don't um outgoing smart athletic he would um yeah i wish i wasn't i was so short fused i wish i wasn't depressed i wish i didn't feel like i needed something to help me sleep i wish i was just completely dependable on myself um when i was younger my father would uh he once hit my dog in front of me 'cause he was mad at me so he started hitting the dog and i don't that was probably the biggest thing xxx i was little i remember just being sad yeah everyone has something they regret <deep breath> <sigh> not to be so naive hmm uh i went to hypnosis i had a a an appointment for hypnosis a few days ago it was really relaxing really calming and i feel like it could help me um one of my mom's colleagues referred her to a psychiatrist who's really good with a_d_h_d and patients like that <laughter> um i'm athletic um i'm nice i like to i put other people before myself most of the time i don't know if that's a negative quality or positive i i don't know my ideal weekend i would either go to a a few parties or i'll i'll hang out with my girlfriend out in fullerton or i'll be in los angeles or the beach um i haven't really felt like i've accomplished anything to be adequately proud of but i did very well in sports in high school and that's really it k bye 
<synch> yes i am i am pretty good uh i was born in los angeles california yes um i like the fact that everything is close by um all the stores the shops xxx um the traffic <laughter> um i've traveled but not too much uh going away from your usual days um exploring new sights um three weeks no a month ago i went to las vegas uh with <wit> me and my friends and we just went sightseeing um in las vegas we went to the hoover dam and um it was breathtaking um the it was really big and we saw the the big canyon and it was impressive i've never seen something like that before i studied nursing uh i graduated two months ago so i took my uh board exam to be licensed and i passed so i'm just waiting for my license in the mail my dream job is to be a registered nurse um long time ago when i was a little boy i got injured and my parent had to take me to the hospital and um the doctors came by and they had to stitch me up on the leg and i saw all of that and that made me want to pursue it the medical field uh yes i am very happy uh my relationship with my family is okay not good not bad it's it it's in between <laughter> uh i am close i am very close to them um mm if i have a problem i i go to them for help um someone who's been a positive influence has been my best friend since elementary school yes yes uh we've known each other since we were in the third grade and we've uh we've gone to elementary middle school and high school together and he lives like two blocks away so he's basically like like a brother of <o> of mine i am shy um i really don't know i've i've always been a quiet person um ever since i can remember hmm what do i do i i go into my room i turn my a_c on and i just relax in my bed <laughter> i am pretty good i'm pretty good at controlling my temper yes the last time i argued with someone was about um work i was disappointed um not angry just disappointed because my manager he wanted me to do something faster than what i usually can handle and he already knew that um my workload was a lot but he didn't understand that so that made me just very like sad mm i cannot remember one the hardest decision i ever had to make was dropping out of school um i felt that i didn't really belong uh far away from home and so i was just thinking ahead um i was in a major that i didn't really like and so i decided to just not go next semester and go back home to l_a um right now that i'm looking at it yes i i am very happy that i did that because i wouldn't have gone to nursing school and i wouldn't have been a licensed vocational nurse right now hmm i don't have an event um it depends on the days um where i work or where i don't work yes right now i i work at um at a retail store early in the morning i i go at three in the morning and i get out at ten a_m so it's really hard for me to get a good night's sleep when i don't sleep well i can be a little bit grumpy uh irritated or just frustrated with the situation lately i've been okay <o> okay i've been good uh no i have not no no hmm the last time i was really really happy and excited was when i found out that i passed my license board exam to be a nurse <laughter> my best friend would've described <des> would describe me as a caring nice sweet shy quiet guy um physically speaking i would change how i look from the outside um i i'm a little <l> i'm overweight and i would like to lose some weight and just look good from the outside hmm i don't have one no i don't um this one time i <sigh> at my work uh it's a retail store i i kinda took some merchandise without buying it um it was a risk that i took but um since no one was around and the opportunity <opp> the opportunity was right there for me to get it i just got it and i took it home i don't know yes last weekend i went to i i went yard saleing with my family and it was pretty fun and going out to different yard sales and finding uh random stuff um i bought this big black bean bag it was huge and it was on it was only for two dollars and so i got it and now it's in my room and i sit on it <laughter> i am most proud of is the fact that i am a nurse um that i am a nurse um i'm just waiting for my for my license in the mail and after that i would just send out my resumes to different hospitals and xxx and nursing homes bye 
<sync> mhm um i'm doing good what about you mhm um l_a <l> los los angeles but i currently reside <res>reside in inglewood wait did i answer your question i don't know okay l_a um the murals the ocean what else the people my family's over here so that's the best part what about you oh wait yeah <laughter> um i would say the smog yeah the air it could be cleaner and yeah um that's pretty <pre> i mean there's good people and bad people too but yeah for the most part it's all good um yeah i've been to mexico <me> uh mexico and the temples and northern california so yes traveling like cleaner air that's good it's healthier for your body cleaner bloodflow the um people culture and stories and when you come back you share stories with like your friends yeah um any time like right now or when okay so like this one time when i was kid we went out to the temples and um it started raining so we just start walking through and like when we get to the top one thing i didn't know before is that the higher you go the the smaller the steps get so like people back then had uh smaller feet so what happened was as i went higher towards the temple i had to walk sideways so my feet could measure up to the the the steps but once you get up there it's a nice view i yeah uh general education but um mainly art yeah i took a lot of a lot of art classes um well when i was a kid i scribbled on walls with crayola so i figured you know like it kinda stuck around with me so i just pursued it so yeah my dream job would be to get paid for painting painting art yeah um yeah pretty simple um it's not so much that it's hard it just requires passion um persistence and faith and will you just have to really believe in yourself the more you believe in yourself the more likely you are able to succeed mhm i consider myself to be shy in certain um time and places but i am also out outgoing when like i have the energy so i feel like it's well balanced you know like i'm shy when it's i guess okay to be shy you know and i'm outgoing when like the need to actually um have fun or just explore it feels good like if that makes sense but yeah <laughter> yeah to uh relax um either well i don't know if i should say this but i smoke weed <laughter> so that helps and i like painting painting pretty much helps me relax you know especially when i use the color blue because the color blue um relaxes me and also green when i use these two colors and make a painting it calms <calm>calms me down yeah and you have a blue shirt yeah my temper um well my thoughts my thoughts control my emotions and my emotions yeah that's pretty much how my temper i i try to make sense you know like is it worth getting mad or if i do get mad what will be the outcome you know so controlling my temper is just by training my thought um <sigh> the last time i argued with somebody was with my with my father and it was because i wanted to eat food but he wanted me to buy wine so right when the food was ready i was hungry to eat and he was like no so that kinda frustrated me and the way i handled it was like well i could just eat when i come back and i'm doing him a favor so you know and then after you know i could just eat in eat in peace so yeah my family um it's pretty good um my mom my dad have a good relationship still <s>still married and my brothers and sisters um we help one another out so that's good it's just yeah it's like a team a situation i wish i could handle differently would be hmm that's a good question i mean can i get a scenerio okay um a situation i could handle differently well see that's the thing like i feel like if i'm calm in any situation i could figure it out you know but if it came down to like a rubik's cube maybe how would i handle the situation would be just by uh failing um failing making mistakes because i would make the right mistakes and the right lessons would come after so that's the best way i could answer your question you know yeah a positive influence pretty much anybody who told me the truth has been a positive influence  influence  you know like yeah even though it may hurt like oh the truth does hurt well they're not trying to be mean they're actually good influences so i would say my friends uh my mom my dad my brother my sisters yeah mm well see that's the thing like you like i have i've had some pretty bad experiences with like being at gunpoint and with a knife but at the end of the day what that did was like give me more insight it made me more aware and it taught me how to read people a little bit more like just sense things out and also how to avoid situations so even though it was bad and it did kinda like scar me it did prepare me for like the world you know because this happened to me when i was like twelve thirteen years old so i was already being exposed to like you know like guns knives and all that stuff so it's it's bad but it's good in the long term you know because if you get out of that slump it's like nothing else would really phase you because oh you think you know in your head like oh i've been through worse so it's not as bad you know and so yeah the hardest um man this one right now uh see for a the moment i got stuck i was like trying to think that was that was part of it but uh hardest decision as far as like life changing life changing whether to continue school college or not mm i kinda chose to like i went to school but i chose to pursue my own like like i'm learning more by connecting myself with people who are already in the field i wanna be in so that was a hard choice because there was no um guarantee that i would like run into like the right people but i took that chance and you know i met the right people so yeah yeah yeah um it's actually really easy i sometimes yeah like if i wanted to i could sleep right now in like ten minutes you know i could just like shut down my mind like yeah just calm down like like slow down my air pattern yeah mhm lately i've been feeling good i've been feeling like i have free will like at this point in time i feel like if i chose a path any path with like my heart i could get there you know but i'm kind of like still deciding it's like everything in all all these paths are in the air just trying to make my own i don't know that's where i'm at i feel like i have free will so yeah lately like in the past two weeks or today <laughter> okay uh yeah you know like um yeah things happen that would change like my feelings and for example right now it just happened huh for right now like this experience for one is kind of like a shift in my thought because yeah it's like it's technology you know it's like it's a trip to see how far like one could take a thought and then make it reality so that's kinda like shifting my thoughts right now this experience this this whole experience yeah uh post traumatic stress disorder no depression i know how it's like to be depressed but diagnosed by a doctor no uh depression how how it feels how does depression feel like it feels like it's like a bird in a cage being depression is like being <ss> a fish who can't swim in the water i have feeling depression is like being a bird without wings um pretty much it feels like you're limited but then the thing is to get out of that depression it's like you have to awaken and change your perspective and focus on like i i would say colors colors help and people talking to people helps yeah um being depressed mm let's see mm i don't know like it could <cou> it could come like it could happen everyday in like in small doses doses so like i i could say today you know earlier when i was just by myself i felt a little depressed but then what happened i fixed it like called up a friend and met up with him and yeah um i mean at this moment i feel pretty happy you know i'm talking to a virtual person it's pretty cool and yeah right now i feel happy <laughter> um sometimes hard headed like he would try to teach me um a certain lesson whether it's art or just like in my character and yeah he would probably just describe me as like like like he would listen but at the same time he'll still do what he wants to do so pretty much like i don't know yeah i mean that's what he tells me but yeah overall good person um probably just exercise um my diet food my food intake and yeah just exercise pretty much it my health mm i would say when i was like in middle school or in elementary a little bit of high school too but what it would yeah what it would be was it would either be about um well pretty much my art <laughter> like if i ever did something and i thought it was good then someone else would be like oh you know that looks kinda like like trash and then i'd be like oh damn either i could accept it and be like yeah it does kinda look and then fix it or what i would do back then would be like damn you know just kinda dwell on that thought and then just like stay there for a bit and then eventually i'll come out of it but yeah usually it's um people's words and ideas that yeah yeah so that's it regret um yeah i got a couple things i regret like what well sometimes i feel like i should've completed a whole university thing but i mean at the same time i feel like if i really wanted to go i would have gone so yeah that's kind of a regret in my head ten or twenty years ago would be um seek spiritual well being you know learn how to um handle your thoughts choose your thoughts i would teach myself um pick the right <r> people you surround yourself with because that   definitely has a major influence in your environment uh certain events you would experience and as far as your overall happiness yeah yeah among other things but yeah what i'm most proud of right now is my paintings yeah i'm proud of that because like i feel like these paintings i'm releasing are things that no one else could duplicate you know it's like it's one of a kind and like it's it's there you know it's has own signature so so yeah i'm i'm pretty happy about that yeah thank you alright thank you mhm alright bye <laughter> 
<synch> yes i'm okay with this i'm pretty good feeling a little tired but uh feeling pretty good for the most part um redondo beach yep i like the beach i like the mountains i love how you could go surfing in the morning go snowboarding in the day um i like to go hiking up in these mountains santa monica mountains to be exact i don't like the traffic i don't like the congestion of people here and i don't like the price of <o> the cost of living in specific areas uh i've been trying to actually um last year was the summer of really road tripping and getting out there with my girlfriend um we're looking to go to costa rica and hopefully to south america this summer and then maybe even doing a road trip down the south see some of the southern states but uh i've been to canada i've been to mexico and ecuador and been to various states here and there trying to get out there i love meeting new people i love experiencing new things trying different <diffing> different foods that are native to that local area and it's just part of the journey i just i love exploring this you know this planet we call earth um just recently we went to seattle and canada with a couple friends and uh it was gorgeous we uh flew into seattle and we saw the city for the first two three days and then rented a car and headed over to vancouver canada and saw british columbia and boy was it gorgeous just very lush beautiful trees the uh the climate was nice the ocean was right there it was people were great it was just a fun trip all around yeah <deep breath> <sigh> one of my most memorable <sigh> memorable experiences was probably the uh the trip we took to colorado last summer and uh me and my girlfriend flew into denver and we didn't really have a plan we knew we knew of a couple people who were living there and um just the day before we had to uh contacted them and telling 'em we're coming in the area and they were just showed great hospitality they picked us up at the airport let us crash at their place for a couple days we even let us use their car to explore the state and go to wyoming and see the the neighbors to the north it was just a great trip great people and it was just everything worked out very well just every day was there was something new and fun to do yeah i uh i studied business management and uh economics right now um i've always wanted to own my own business and i figured management be a a good uh foundation to build on and uh learn more about so i decided to go into management just to see the various aspects of what it takes to really manage your own business and um and then economics is just to just for long term investments i really wanted to start earning some stocks and e_t_fs and mutual funds and start buidling my portfolio up so i figured economics would be a great way for a long term investment financially so that's why i did my economics yeah i'm really stoked it was one of the best decisions probably of my my life yeah i consider myself more outgoing i'm i'm pretty friendly i don't mind to open up to people and stuff <sigh> i like to be outside like to go hiking i like to go um working out at the gym but i mostly like to be outdoors i i love nature and just to be outside just just puts me at ease from pretty good for the most part i'm pretty mellow chill guy and when i do get angry here and there i uh it just lasts for like a couple minutes and before i know it i just it just blows over i don't tend to hold on to things or stay angry and hold grudges just 'cause there's no need to life's too short for all that um see i can't even remember the last time i argued with anybody i have no idea probably when my uh my brother and my girlfriend got in a little little argument uh like two birthdays ago and it's been awkward kinda ever since um i wish i would've just handled it right then and there rather than it letting it just stretch out as long as it has been it's just awkward for both parties i wish i just would've communicated with both of them and told 'em to you know set their differences aside and let's just communicate and try to see we come up with a solution but now it's just awkward yeah it does the hardest decision i've ever had to make man that's a toughy i don't think i've had too many tough decisions to really say the hardest decision i've ever had to make um maybe not moving to colorado for my undergrad two three years ago was a little tough just 'cause i kinda think what if but other than that nothing has really been too tough in my life that was really that hard of a decision i don't really feel guilty about anything pretty good person i think and for the most part i couldn't think of anything something i could wish i could erase from my memory um nothing really to be honest i i love all my memories they're usually positive for the most part i know that's kinda weird for somebody to say but i've lived a pretty good life and i'm happy yeah uh it's cool um i'm pretty independent for the most part so when i do see 'em here and there it's it we go through long periods of times with no contact maybe a couple weeks sometimes even a month but uh when i see 'em it's it's good you know i like to say hi and show 'em i love 'em still and it's not that i don't mean to like not contact 'em they could always contact me but uh it's good for the most part i guess as a young adult mm my girlfriend's family uh they've been very positive in my life uh if it wasn't for them i think i'd be in a different direction just 'cause in high school i didn't really care about higher education i didn't care about really thinking long term and uh just seeing them <th> them and what their family does and how they think differently like with your higher education and how to get somewhere in life and the if you do these things this is what it could lead to and they've been very successful they own their own uh accounting practice and seeing that influenced me to achieve higher in life yeah it's pretty easy for the most part i just close my eyes and wake up in the morning i'm tired sometimes i'm could sense that i'm a little drained and uh maybe get a little groggy here and there and that's it feeling pretty good for the most part a little stressed out just 'cause finals are uh next week and uh i really really wanna do well and just you know close out this last semester and i graduate in two weeks and um for the most part that's that's the only thing i'm really nervous about but for the most part i'm really excited i'm looking forward to going to maui for a week after graduation i'm fired up i'm fired up to see what the future holds where we gonna live <l> me and my girlfriend gonna live and what other trips are planned for the summer i'm just i'm excited to be done with school for a little while yeah i have never been diagnosed with p_t_s_d i've never been diagnosed with depression <sigh> the last time i felt really happy was probably seeing my girlfriend graduate a couple days ago she had uh just graduated from nursing school on monday and uh to see her walk across stage and stuff just 'cause we've been together for six years and seeing her go through the nursing program for five and it's just seeing all the ups and downs it's really good to see somebody just strive through and achieve what they want to achieve and just made me really proud of her yeah probably outgoing friendly positive vibes all around adventurous loves sports team player knows how to be a leader here and there and uh gets a little outspoken sometimes no not really for the most part no not really just be a little more motivated i used to be so motivated and right now i'm just maybe 'cause i'm just done with school and i'm over it that i just don't feel as motivated but i just i wanna be more motivated and determined right now and that's not i'm not going that way right now so mhm no biggie <sigh> oh man i couldn't can't really think of a time i went caving two weeks ago that was a lot of fun uh we went up to sequoia national park and uh i went caving with a for an r_t_m class it's like this uh recreational tourism management class and caving was an elective and our professor was like a world renowned cave specialist and he took us to these various caves in uh sequoia and just me and these strangers or my classmates and becoming really good friends at the end was a lot of fun and rappelling down into caves climbing back up going through different rooms and chutes it was a lot of fun that was yeah ten or twenty years ago i'd probably say just stay more focused on school a little less on the social aspects and uh kinda stick with one sport just to see how far that could get ya um <sigh> sometimes not playing hockey through uh through middle school and hockey sometimes <someti> i mean through middle school and high school sometimes and um and that's pretty much it now i'm proud <sigh> that uh i'm really proud that i'm graduating getting my bachelor's and i'm looking to get a full time job i work at a law firm now so i have something going for me  um i'm really proud to be a motivated and determined person long term wise <w> long term thinking wise i'm a well-rounded person and i really wanna explore the world so i'm kinda proud that i opened my eyes to that and now i have different perspectives and really have a open mind to people and rather than judging 'em you know it's liberty why not let 'em do what they want and uh i'm really proud to just be finally getting my bachelor's and hopefully going for my m_b_a in a couple years for sure bye 
<synch> yes i'm doing well thank you from los <l> los angeles mm sports outdoor sports mainly surfing uh snowboarding mountain biking rock climbing traffic yes experiencing different cultures uh well uh i love going to mexico and uh eh it's so much diffferent from california and western culture so to speak i know mexico is a western civilization but uh the uh the level of of entertainment and the level of education is so much different that uh eh they're like two different worlds traveling you mean uh i would have to say going to an island off the coast of figi the name is tavarua and it's a very small island you can walk around it in thirty minutes thirty or forty minutes and uh it's a place where you go to go surfing and it it is an incredible uh visually incredible and uh experientially incredible place i studied biology uh i was pushed from behind by my father who was a medical doctor and uh he wanted me to become a medical doctor also not at all i'm working in areas of business now yes i am my dream job would be to be a missionary yes my father's initial objective when he became an m_d was to become a missionary and uh he's a very generous person and i think i am too i i i got that from him uh hereditarily but uh i would like to help people eh and i don't think being a doctor is helping people i really don't i think it's uh disingenuous to say you're helping people while you're stuffing wads of cash into your pocket i would like to be uh building people homes and uh helping them find fresh water sources things like that if i could afford to travel to remote places like that i exercise i think i'm pretty good at it uh uh i think i'm pretty effective at it it was probably two days ago it was my girlfriend and it was about her uh lack of consideration um i felt frustrated hmm a situation which i wished i could handle differently um i eh in my later years i would say eh i don't have many regrets in my younger years i used to uh be snubbed by people and i would keep my mouth shut and i wouldn't say anything i would not express my displeasure of their actions or their behavior i would just keep my mouth closed and internalize my feelings i've learned that that is so wrong and so in the probably the last fifteen to twenty years i have made it a point to vocalize my displeasure with someone's actions right away and that uh takes care of the anger immediately yes it <i> it depends what you mean by trouble uh i think eh all the way around once you take the beginning <benning> the beginning to the end uh it diffuses trouble rather than prolongs or protracts the trouble uh going back it would be to not to pursue uh medicine like my father wanted we argued uh at length for many months and years about this and uh finally i prevailed and uh i didn't go to i didn't go that route uh but that was probably the most uh uh difficult period in my life mm there was a time when i wished i could erase a female interactions uh girlfriends and and their uh betrayals uh but now i realize that keeping those memories make me who i am today and and dealing with them defines who i am today uh my parents are deceased i had very good relationships with my parents uh i'm very thankful for that um even though my father was somewhat of a uh hard-handed uh and draconian <laughter> person uh we came to an understanding well before he died and uh my brothers i get along great with my younger brother but my older brother has issues he has uh psychological issues and they <th> they continue to plague him and to affect me also just just knowing that he's going through uh turmoil uh well i guess i really don't cope with it because um he's clinically depressed and he has suicidal tendencies and uh he's not working he's very highly educated and he uh well he doesn't talk to me and uh his family is very abusive towards him it's an not a happy relationship for his family yes you know i would have to say my father my father is my hero he's my uh model he's my uh archetype for what a man should be uh he's he was unimpeachably honest and kind uh yet on the other hand he was uh he had high expectations of me and my two brothers eh usually once my head hits the pillow i am dead asleep like a log but lately i've been having uh just last night i couldn't sleep i woke up at two and i have a feeling it's because of a diagnosis of cancer that i received one month ago um xxx i with my own personal uh methods of handling stress i i'm okay i'm probably ninety percent okay that ten percent comes from uh eh an unsuredness about the future about whether i will survive this or not not really no never never oh i was either surfing or snowboarding or rock climbing or mountain biking uh i always experience joy when i'm exercising at a very high level of exertion funny jovial uh uh intelligent a perfectionist hmm eh that's no one's asked me much about that um maybe uh is to submerge my uh hedonistic self i look at once again my father fills my consciousness he was the ultimate um uh deferrer of gratification he put now behind him and he put what will be in the future in his sights and he never let go of that and that's what made him the uh self-made man that he was whereas i am looking always for the present um how i feel now and it's difficult for me to uh slog through a a mile full of uh crap in order to get to a prize that is so far away <deep breath> it would be my ex-boss and he started using at my last day of work when he fired me he started using uh a lot of profanity toward me and eh i turned to him and i said you cannot talk to me that way and he continued to use more profanity until uh i objected to it again and that's when he fired me and uh that that's still in my mind and that occurred a year and a half ago mhm anything i regret uh yeah i regret not getting married and having kids sure i suppose i could uh eh but i think that that would've robbed me of the many opportunities i had and i took to travel around the world and experience different cultures because that's what i enjoy the most about life is exploring and seeing different things and talking to different people and expanding my awareness because the united states is not the end of the world it is <i> eh once you get to travel you find out that we are not we do not have the highest uh level of uh of living in the whole world other people think that we're the only ones that think that and i disagree mm that's a good one i would say <laughter> i would say to just enjoy life because you never know when it's going to end and i think i've done that and uh i may be coming to an end soon uh with this diagnosis of cancer so i think i've done i'm i'm happy with my life thus far i was giving a rock climbing lesson i have a uh part time job of instructing rock climbing and many of these people have never done it before and uh they thanked me and they told me what a great time they had and how this may have changed their lives so that was very gratifying to me <deep breath> i would say <sigh> my devotion to the environment uh i wasn't always an environmentalist but uh i have been uh vocal in the cause of uh uh being a um uh a steward of the environment because today they're a lot of peoples people that are polluting the environment with a lot of chemicals and pollutants and septic uh things like that and i stand up and i uh have been on t_v and on uh youtube speaking up against these people that pollute the environment you're welcome goodbye 
<synch> yes good new jersey five years ago about <bout> once a year um there's more to do out here the weather is nice didn't take very long and the art scene the music scene there's always something to do out here some of the people <laughter> um some of the people are just kinda superficial no i like it out here art um i took a lot of art courses throughout high school um a little um i'd like to create not very hard outgoing because all of my friends tell me i'm outgoing listen to music or read pretty good i don't even remember the last time i argued with someone mm i don't feel guilty about anything mm i can't think of a situation i wish i handled differently probably moving to l_a eh just deciding to go away from my family and come out here was kind of a difficult decision yes it's very good i still talk to them um like almost every day and i see them sometimes so it works out my mom um just kinda taught me to be the person i am today hmm i can't think of an event i wish i could erase from my memory i like it no it's very easy mm i yawn a lot good no no no um whenever i go to the gym i get happy yesterday crazy because i am crazy <laughter> i like myself the way i am i can't think of a time someone made me feel bad about myself no i'd just tell myself that everything's gonna be okay um probably family visits every time i go back it's really nice to see all my family and see what they're up to now um i really enjoy karaoke and i did that recently mm when people put down other people music um art exhibits uh working out my friendships um i'm a good listener and really good at giving my opinion on how to help others 
<synch> yes i'm good how are you uh i was born in hawaii but i grew up in colorado yeah yeah about seven <s> uh seven to eight years ago um i try to go back once a year <ye> once or twice a year yeah um it's how does it compare to l_a um it's it's different it's not as busy there's more uh things to do out outdoors in the mountains uh my family <fam> for work yeah i am i love it here um it took about a year before i really felt comfortable but um once that got through that kinda hard year it was pretty good out here i've had a good time um i love that i can go to the beach uh i love that it's warm most of the time uh i love that i've met a lot of people that love the arts as much as i do the traffic just like everyone else um yeah yeah the traffic and it's pretty much just traffic earthquakes not as much as i'd like um it's just nice to go some place new experience something different um xxx i went to alaska a couple years ago and that was really awesome i got to go fishing in the ocean and i got seasick that wasn't awesome but uh it was cool i saw a bear in real life a bear walked through a yard um it was really different than l_a it was really cool <laughter> english creative writing well i always wanted to tell stories so it just made sense to work on writing in somehow some aspect yeah i am to have my own t_v show where i write it and everyone watches it every week and it's awesome really hard 'cause there's a lot of people that have the same dream so yeah more outgoing than shy uh i like talking to people i enjoy other people mm um go to the movies or turn on music dance pretty good um <sigh> it was at work couple about a month ago <ag> about a month ago um i got mad at someone because i didn't think they were they were giving me clear instructions and so um when i tried to have a conversation about it they got mad and then i got mad and we got mad um i felt like i wasn't being heard or listened to and i felt like we weren't able to have a real dialogue so um because we couldn't have a dialogue i felt like no one was listening to me totally um <makes sound with mouth> i uh i i um no regrets no <laughter> um <laughter> i guess hmm i don't know if there is one i mean i'm sure there is but uh one time i was driving behind someone and they well they cut me off and i think it'd just been one of those days this was like a year ago or two years ago um it was just one of those days where i just didn't want or i just it had been a frustrating day and when this person cut me off and i almost got in an accident with them i just followed them to their parking spot and actually i had honked at them and they they flipped me off and so it just really really got under my skin that someone would cut me off and almost cause an accident and then uh and then flip me off so i i followed them to the spot and i asked i said miss why did you flip me off when you cut me off and and she said oh you know i'm i've had a rough day i don't need your attitude and her daughter was with her and i told her well you're not really setting a very good example for your daughter and you know i didn't need to be petty like that but i just i wanted to be i guess ooh <sigh> mm look at you going deep <laughter> um oh i guess the hardest decision was coming out to my mom uh telling her i was gay i mean it wasn't hard 'cause it was the right one but it was hard to do because my mom was very conservative and she she had trouble accepting it and it it took awhile but once she did you know everything was better and i knew it would be but it was just hard in the moment to you know tell her something she didn't wanna hear okay um when i was a little kid my um my grandfather found our dog run over on the on the road and he uh scrubbed_entry and brought it in and i think i remember as a kid just uh like seeing death like that really just threw me off and uh frightened me and uh it was just one of those moments that i i guess i wish i hadn't been there for because my grandmother was destroyed she was just so sad and uh it was just one of those moments i guess you need as a kid but i didn't really wanna experience like loss like that in your face yeah my relationship with my family is pretty good um we're probably not as close as most but uh we you know we always we don't talk often but we talk with love and we always love each other when we see each other um my grandmother was very positive she was always very encouraging and told me to uh you know pursue my dreams and not to let the little things get me down so i'm glad i had her usually it's easy um sometimes it's not um well i've been between jobs recently i start a new job uh next week but while i've been off uh while i haven't been working um i tend to like my body wants to stay up later and later and later and i'm trying not to like fall into the pattern of going to sleep at like two or three and getting up at like eleven so i keep trying to make myself go to sleep by like midnight or twelve thirty and i just end up laying in bed for like an hour or an hour and a half when i should be i should <sh> i should be able to just go to sleep and get up at like nine but still wanna stay up i guess uh a little scatterbrained like today i'm a little scatterbrained 'cause uh i i tried to go to sleep early again and i ended up tossing and turning and so <sigh> scatterbrained <laughter> um well since i've had a lot of time on my hands like i don't usually have this much time on my hands so sometimes it can be frustrating because um you don't know what to do with it when you're not working i guess um but yeah i think that answers the question um i just that maybe a little more absent-minded than usual just lately with uh the not working thing no mm mm um a couple days ago when i got my new job <laughter> when i got hired um outgoing listening uh attentive um fun loyal i think i hope um i wish that i uh i probably wish that i looked better i wish i had more hair up here mm losing it a little bit uh probably wish i was a little skinnier this this girdle's pretty tight <laughter> and um you know sometimes i wish i had more money but nothing too drastic i'm okay yeah oh um mm hmm when i was a little kid i was uh i was the fat <f> i was the fat kid and um gosh i remember i was like i was going into high school and it was like the second day and i remember this guy came up to me and was um like he was like pretty nice to me i thought and i didn't realize he'd like this is like out of a movie right like he had put bandaids on my back that said like i'm a fat cow and said like uh like yeah like just a bunch of mean stuff and i didn't know and i walked around with it for like half an hour i heard people laughing and i didn't get it and then finally this girl just came up to me and was like hey there's like bandaids on your back that say all these mean things and then she just walked away she didn't like help me take 'em off and i remember like i couldn't get 'em i was trying to find 'em and then um i just remember like putting my head in my locker and like i didn't want anyone to see me cry so i just like put my head in my locker and like pretended like i was looking at stuff in my backpack but really i was you know the crying fat kid who couldn't get the mean stickers off his back mm yeah anything um probably yeah <sharp inhale> um you know i would xxx i would try to keep i would try to let myself know to to look at things positively and to not like worry what other people think about you i think i spent too much time as like a adolescent worrying what people thought of me and as i got older i didn't care as much and i started enjoying life a lot more so uh i went to coachella it's a music festival it was three days with all of my friends and my boyfriend and we uh we danced and we went swimming and we barbecued and we laughed and had a great time yeah oh <sigh> um i guess my my career humble as it may be uh i really stuck in l_a um a long time when it was uh when like it was hard i stayed <stay> i stuck around i didn't quit so you know i'm proud that i've managed to like follow my dreams and really stay out here and try to make it in hollywood my pleasure bye bye bye

<synch> yes uh good thanks the east coast for work uh rarely i prefer it out here uh i it's um not as nice as the lifestyle out here i like the weather better and uh just a lot of things about living here it's my favorite city so uh somewhat um but i mostly what's that um just um i like to go to france a lot i like the food there and um just the uh lifestyle the shopping that sort of thing uh art history and marketing uh well um i became interested in high school and i thought it was a good um classical education uh and um i interned at andy warhol's magazine when i was in high school and so that scrubbed_entry hmm yes yes uh eh i'm pretty happy with what i'm i'm doing i do um consulting so i write marketing plans that sort of thing um it's can be fairly hard about writing a marketing plan um uh i don't know it's hard it's hard to um <laughter> to talk to someone who's about it who's not in marketing it it requires just um a knowledge of uh you know how it's how it how it's done and it it takes uh several months to to do one so um well i guess i'm i originally kind of shy but um i i become more outgoing just 'cause of work and stuff um i like to exercise uh i i do um hiking with my dogs we walk up up and down a hill a couple times is it good uh i don't remember um i don't know nothing comes to mind mm um sometimes i don't i don't clean my car it might get lots of dog hair in it and i feel bad when i i should always stay on top of that just getting to the car wash and stuff uh well i had a conflict with my brother and so um i had to decide to have an estrangement from him and that makes the most sense and that was a a somewhat difficult decision but just because of his angry behavior it wasn't it wasn't that difficult but um you know it was <wa> it was somewhat difficult because i i loved him very much so um i'm not close to my family so um but i don't really have one um i have a a japanese friend uh oh i think the sensor came off i have a a japanese friend i'm i'm uh very close with she's like my kind of a my <m> my mother and um scrubbed_entry uh i just met them socially um scrubbed_entry uh i don't know nothing comes to mind <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> <talking to experimenter> um pretty easy 'cause i keep a regular schedule um just <jus> just kind of tired maybe a little bit irritable uh good um well i'm recovering from p_t_s_d so um i sometimes feel the the p_t_s_d and then i'll i'll take a medication for that no it's just uh it's just left over of the i'm still <sti> i still have the stress from it i'm still being treated for it it i don't really have any um i prefer not to talk about it um in the past but it's treated um five years ago uh i was i was just um very sad very depressed and so um i also had anxiety so i i went to to doctor and um they helped me and i did uh psychotherapy yeah for the p_t_s_d though um i don't know i guess uh it's just um just kind of supportive because <be> because of the issues i have with my family it's it's supportive to have a doctor who is supportive and um you know it just uh gives me good feedback and helps me to make good decisions that sort of thing i yeah i have nightmares about my family sometimes yeah thanks oh uh i i just try to uh sleep better i xxx i xxx i xxx before i go to sleep i sort of like um meditate a little bit to get to be calm and then hope that that will help i feel happy all the time pretty much like i my dogs make me happy and you know my life is really happy so mhm uh i guess you know as a a nice person i'm thoughtful um a good friend um <sigh> and happy fun person um i don't know i mean i'm in my forties now so i'm pretty happy with with myself my <m> you know my um you know uh i've i've done a lot of a lot of work on myself in in therapy and stuff so i'm pretty i wouldn't really change a lot i'm pretty happy with myself i mean not to sound conceited but i'm i'm pretty um happy with myself now uh well <we> that would that would be um my parents they're very abusive so i don't <d> i <d> i don't talk to them anymore so <laughter> um any you know any times with them you know they they uh you know said <sai> did terrible things to me so i prefer not to talk about it uh let's see um well i just started reading a book i i like to read um cookbooks and i was just reading a book called um when french women cook and it's about uh a woman's relationship with different women and friends in different parts of france and the and the cooking and so i'm really enjoying that book mhm um i usually you know um get the grocery shopping done which i enjoy i really i really like doing the grocery shopping i go to a few places and and do a bit of cleaning and um uh just uh relax oh yeah i would <wou> i would say um to have better self-esteem 'cause i used to have very low self-esteem you know from being abused and so um you know i i wish i'd been happier <ha> happier in the past and you know it's taken me a long time to become happy because um you know no matter what what i did whatever achievements i i was i was never happy in the past i was i was always you know struggling with being depressed i didn't <di> i didn't even know why and now you know i realize because of whatever events that it that it was from my parents from that um a relationship and so i my i what the advice would be to not um have a relationship that um is bad for you like sometimes estrangement is the best choice in an abusive relationship um just just <j> the way i live my life the way i treat people i think you know um you know i i believe it like your deeds are very important and i try to treat people in a good way and and i guess you know i'm i'm proud of you know with my work like decisions i've made that um that give me um you <y> you know a a a a uh a job that i i like that gives me a lot of flexibility and i you know i do what i

<synch> yes i'm feel great i am from saint louis missouri born and raised yes i've been here a couple times i just recently moved back two months ago saint louis is quite slower uh to take care of a good friend that who who's ill thank you i jumped right back on the bandwagon the climate and the restaurants the dirt and the traffic yes i do uh the road maps following a road map maybe driving myself well we just recently got back from uh colorado went up into the mountains saw the the snow and enjoyed a little fine dining in colorado uh actually going um horseback riding through the royal gorge yes it was i would be more outgoing i'm a people person <laughter> i listen to jazz music and i also draw i've probably mastered controlling my temper through age mm it would've been my husband and it was about financial issues unsure <un> unsure unstable i don't like loud talking or mm loud emotion i like to sit and methodically and logically talk about things not raise my voice hmm most recently with the illness of my friend i wish i would've handled his sister a little differently as far as things that she's wanted me to do that i really needed to tell her otherwise the way they really needed to be done i took her advice where i shouldn't of um we he i was engaged to him fifteen years ago and he recently called me i guess about five years ago and told me he was diagnosed with cancer we've always maintained our friendship and i asked my husband if i could go help him in his time of need and i'm here it has been um a lot of things one he's a good friend of mine and his sister moved out here as well two my son wanted to start his career out here three i love the weather and that's all i can think of at the moment <laughter> mhm uh it would be the the death of my youngest son i don't know where to start as far as he was born premature and since he was born so early i had him in five months versus nine the we we made the decision to take him off life support 'cause he wasn't getting any better so that would've been the the hardest decision i made with my husband mhm um i really don't wanna erase anything from my memory i've actually um learn and experience and gain knowledge from from things that happen so i'm not <ss> i'm not one to put things erase things out of my mind i categorize them and place them in memories uh it's very close lost my mother at a young age and uh all of us siblings and my father still remain very close mm my father oh he's very health conscious very energetic and exercises <e> uh exercises and has a spirituality about him that uh i want to have as well it's a contentment that he that he portrays that i that i would like to have as well no problem very confused or um skittish i guess would be the word lately fine <f> fine except for the fact that my um good friend who i'm helping take care of we just got out of the hospital so it's been a little hectic the last two days um no not lately no i have not no i have not um i was excited um with good friends in good company i should say and um i had just got back from a concert so it was outside it was enjoyable music i was with good friends we ate well and enjoyed the moment uh as a giving spiritual normal person i don't know <laughter> um i can't think of anything that i'd wanna change except for maybe exercise a little more i i can't recall one off hand no to have save more money and to not try and accomplish everything at once i started out in cosmetology then i went into um college have some college in mathematics and finance traveling mm i had a lot <lo> i like to i enjoy um good food nice wine and company i just went last night to a very nice italian restaurant and was in the company of good friends and family and we dined and talked and that was fun most proud of i guess it would be my children you're welcome bye bye 
<synch> yes i'm fine thank you detroit michigan yes i moved to l_a myself in two thousand and seven but my family came here many more years ago more like forty years ago uh i don't go back to detroit anymore i really don't like the weather and i really don't have any reason to most of my immediate family is out here in california and uh completely different um for me detroit was just very cold it it wasn't the best for my personality i prefer l_a more open space a warmer climate warmer people just a different different uh vibe that i that i like better after my husband and i relationship ended i had family out here so i thought it would be easier to start over here than some of the other places i had lived or to stay where we were at extremely easy i came out here every year to visit while i was in college so i was extremely used to it plus i had also taken um six months out of off of school and lived out here and went to school out here so i was completely used to it well like i said the weather is number one it's just uh less crowded it's more open space it's a a calmer friendlier vibe less rushed the smog would be one and when i drive the traffic in certain areas it can be but um in general there's not a lot that i don't like <l> it's like i guess the overall threat of earthquake but that's isn't really that much of a factor 'cause it rarely happens the price of real estate <laughter> that's another one that i don't necessarily like i can't see your shoes i can't see your shoes at all so i don't travel as much as i used to but i have traveled worldwide new experiences well i used to be an international flight attendant and then later i traveled through my work as a cruise line and as an international sales account executive so i've traveled a lot of different places and um i'll have to say they were all pretty much enjoyable 'cause you know there's different cultures different things to see do learn enjoy experience uh my experiences i would say in um europe visiting moreso i've also visited uh in south south america i guess 'cause the cultures are so very different i would probably say more shy um in general um compared to people who i know are really really outgoing although i've had them describe me as outgoing i like to read i like to walk or power walk or hike listen to music you know i'm very good at controlling my temper oh probably when i was married with my husband many years ago it it could be many things i don't even know in specific but just anything in general pretty much could turn into a debate slash argument with him it could be it could be a choice of uh some of the instances when i might've been with him and i you know got emotional or let it bother me that he made such a big deal of something rather than um just you know seen it as not something to respond to perhaps but it would always be we're we were also pushed to answer so you know you can't always just say ignore a person there 'cause many times it's just a matter of ignoring situation and it doesn't escalate but some people you know don't respond to the so-called norm if you ignore it mm uh they'll just you know de-escalate but that's not always the case i taught middle school kids and you can try calm um methods with them but that doesn't always work but you always have to as the teacher maintain you know your professional demeanor so you can't really um even when they you know the kids do something outrageous or possibly dangerous to themselves or other kids so well that could be several mm um i guess a decision in um along with my mom deciding to let a relative have surgery uh that you know the outcome was uncertain it could go either way and in that case she died so you know uh it's a pretty hard decision 'cause you don't know but you also know if you don't that it could be very serious outcome for them as well mhm <sigh> oh many different things that could occur you know in life you always are second guessing things that you might could do but they also can be learning experiences so is it necessarily a good thing to erase them you know if you can look at it as positive sometimes people can have a strong reaction and they don't really look past the uh impact of the event 'cause there might be something that you can gain from that but there are i i grew up in a home of dysfunction so there was just domestic abuse you know and um there were many incidences so you can't just say only one 'cause there is lots of traumatic things but it also would've been a different outcome in say learning to deal with some of the things that occur in life as an adult that sometimes i see among acquaintances or friends that have not had really strong experiences fall apart or just have very very difficult times dealing with so um you can listen you know you and i and i 'cause i understand that not everybody's had the same experience you know you can walk them through levels of understanding and you know as you know someone you have a balance of background information on which to help them pull from and to see that you know things will progress in a better way knowing that this isn't like the end of the world or as terrible as it seems that it could be and you can also relate other experiences to them of things that were worse or you know seem to be and of course there's always in general i mean when you look at all the calamities in the world you know most of those things aren't affecting us or the people that we know here so that provides us perspective that you know can pull someone out of their i won't necessarily say self-absorption but the seemingly intensity of their experience right at the moment well we have a a good relationship they eh for the most part there are different levels of um stress and trauma that some of my siblings have experienced so it has made them interact with life and people you know more intensely than others some have not had um as much experience in life that will help them deal with things you know in a different way so it's always evolving and i walk in positivity as a a lead of you know uh the way i respond to uh try and engender a more positive response from them rather than feed sometimes the um very strong reactions or responses or interactions that they may have pardon i didn't <di> i didn't hear you could you repeat hmm hmm my mother different teachers friends well my mother has always been a very calm um person for the most part easygoing even though she's experienced a lot of negativity i've had teachers that have um been very um positive <po> positive and proactive and have you know taught independent thinking and techniques to rise above some of the things that were occurring and just various friends that you know i would see handling situations sometimes more much more more difficult you know dealing with things so it depends for the most part it's you know pretty good um it depends if i'm dealing with a lot of things or studying or you know um trying to get more hours in the day 'cause i need to get things done then you know it's less but um in general i don't have a problem sleeping it's just if i make myself stay awake <aw> stay up because there's more stuff that i wanna get done i've been feeling okay uh less you know stressful in xxx it it goes in general 'cause i'm got several projects that i'm working on so um but in general good like i mean not in particular i mean i just seems um less stressful as i get more stuff done i just and the stress comes from sometimes there being a lot more things to do in a shorter period of time but you know reorganizing some of the things that need to be done you know can smoothe that out no i haven't but i know it's something that a lot of uh say veterans in particular have people have i have not no well there's several i guess um and happiness comes in small or large things but in general every day <d> every day every every moment to me is i mean <mea> i mean every day every morning is great wonderful you know day of happiness um as far as big celebratory kinds of things i don't have big highs and lows like that i think it's something that should be on your continuum you know in every day it can be a really great meal it could be a great view it could be you know a moment shared with someone you know so it should be an even on an even keel um as uh uh perseverant um you know i will continue forth and and um positive upbeat um maybe not doing things differently when i were younger like spending my money differently or or spending my time you know a little more differently but that's hard to say it's like okay as your get older you can see you know you could've done some things differently instead of buying the house that i did i would've you know waited and bought another one i mean things like that i would have um made myself move to california sooner and i'm i would have um instead of buying the house that i bought then if i'd know i would <ss> would have you know the situation i have now waited to get something different but you know how can you you know have that hindsight you make the best decision that you can at the time with the best information <in> information available you know after you have looked at several options of um being independent and educated able to uh take care of myself okay bye bye now 
<synch> yes fine oh san fernando valley uh well i really like the culture i love going to museums and being able to go at night and having lots of people around it's spread out a lot and it's a pain in the ass to have to drive everywhere and not have a good public transportation system uh not really i like to go camping but i don't really travel um i think <sigh> it might've been around six months ago i went on a trip with a geology class yeah it was fun hmm <sigh> i think it's tough to say um well i think the first time i went camping was probably really memorable i went to death valley and i got to see a lot of really cool things and hang out with my friends at night philosophy yes um hmm i don't know i think it just sort of happened i wanted to be a journalist for a really long time and then i kind of grew disillusioned with that and i liked all the different ways or all the different things i could do with philosophy huh i don't know but i really like children and i really like studying their behavior so i think something along those lines might be it i think i'm generally pretty outgoing i tend to be shy around my family but when i'm around friends and stuff i i think i'm pretty friendly um a lot of times i'll watch t_v or read um yeah i think i'm pretty good i don't really get mad i try to think about other things if i start getting mad or um i just start trying to focus on my breathing i think the last time i argued with someone it was probably with my boyfriend um but i'm having trouble remembering what the last thing we argued about was um i think it was <wa> i wasn't feeling very well and i was having trouble deciding whether i wanted to go to his department's end of year party and he was getting frustrated which i thought was very inconsiderate 'cause i wasn't feeling well to begin with well i felt like he wasn't really taking my feelings into consideration and i really hate when he gets stressed out or gets angry easily because i just see that as unnecessary and it stresses me out hmm i think a lot of times when my oldest youngest brother or my oldest little brother uh does something wrong i tend to be harsh with him um we're not as close as my sister and i or my youngest brother and i and so he tends to be hostile back and i think that if i were a little bit more gentle it might be easier to communicate with him hmm um when i was nineteen i came home from a party i think around four a_m on a sunday morning and my dad got really mad at me and yelled at me said a lot of not very nice things and then he didn't speak to me for about a year uh well my relationship with my mom is a lot better now that i don't live at home um i used to be really frustrated with her all the time 'cause she has a really quick temper but i think now that i've got a little bit more distance i can see that she did the best that she could um <sigh> and i love my siblings i again my little sister and i get along really well she's four years younger than me and when when she was around twelve and i was around sixteen it was really difficult 'cause she had a really harsh temper and she was always moody and i wasn't in a place to be patient with that sort of stuff so we fought all the time but we don't anymore and that's really great and we get along okay with my uh my older little brother who's fifteen and i think i get along pretty well with my youngest brother who's twelve scrubbed_entry one of the first not the first but one of my first philosophy professors and i really loved her classes and it was really good uh being in a class with a professor who really cared and who really engaged people that was really motivating since not all my classes were like that i think it's pretty easy i mean sometimes i'll have trouble going to sleep but generally it's not that bad it's i think it's usually harder for me to wake up in the morning um well i'm really tired i can get grumpy but i think usually i'm just groggy pretty good i'm a little anxious about um about getting a job and i'm gonna be taking summer school about it's only one class so i'll have a lot of free time um yeah <sigh> well i mean it's not the end of the world if i don't get a job but i know that i will eventually so mostly i think i just try not to think about it too much and i try not to be pessimistic no no hmm well i think the last time i felt really happy i went to a party with my boyfriend the end of department party and um i was the you know i knew a couple people there so i felt comfortable but i was also able to meet new people and there were a couple kids there splashing around in the pool and i had a couple drinks and ate some food and it was fun um she would probably say that i'm smart and uh pretty intellectual i love to read and to watch really like serious films and t_v um and she would probably also say that i'm fun 'cause we like to go out and have fun a lot well i'm kinda <ki> i can be really disorganized and that gets me in trouble sometimes so um so that's a major one that and procrastinating hmm um i got into a little bit of trouble a few months back and had to go to court and was uh uh given eh sixty some hours of community service and of course i procrastinated on doing that so i had to show up to court again to get an extension and the judge was very mean and he didn't seem i mean he yelled at me but it didn't seem like he gave it much thought it seemed like it was just sort of a stock speech he gave everyone that he thought needed some yelling at so i understand 'cause that's his job but it was was not great for me 'cause i wasn't i i was really anxious in that situation well i would've been twelve and two um but i think i think i would've told myself at twelve not to be so hard on myself and not to be so hard on my parents 'cause i think i was a little selfish and self-involved back then i can't really think of anything i mean i regret how i treated my mother when i was a kid but everyone does that and um i do regret a couple of semesters ago i didn't do so well in school and i got a a few ws which i now have to work to get off on my transcript i think so i'm i think i i wasn't focusing in school at that time and i didn't see any counselors at school or anything so i definitely could've done that hmm i think i'd probably spend my ideal weekend sleeping in saturday and then going hiking or maybe just going to the duck pond by my house and feeding ducks and picking some oranges and then maybe going out to breakfast sunday and just like window shopping and maybe watching a little bit of t_v huh well my youngest brother is autistic and my mom and dad were always working when he was growing up i'm ten years older than him so and being the oldest i always i always took care of him which made me really really patient because he was a handful but i'm really proud of how he turned out and um and how close we are
