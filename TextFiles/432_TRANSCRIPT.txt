<synch> i'm cool fine new york yep eh about six months six months ago nicer pace uh photography job it's a good move mm uh i love the weather cool people relax easy to talk to uh nice environment mm crime when you go through some sections yeah i've done my share uh the ability to <sigh> capture events be a part of it be a part of exciting things like um olympics games festivals uh special shows yeah meet new people yeah which one mm canada uh it was nice uh very refreshing mm clean environment uh the people seemed very very lighthearted but you're able to do serious work i love the landscape uh i think it was riding onboard an amtrak train yeah uh liberated photography uh i think i'm doing it you know i really <re> i i really believe i'm doing it um not very difficult you know uh um not at least not for me because i think i have some natural inclination for it uh and um i connect well with people i'm more shy but i'm forced to be outgoing because i you know you can't really get anything done being shy but given a choice i'd rather be um you know a little more pulled back <laughter> uh until i you know i i i feel like just the closest a safe path to go so that kinda curtails with my spirit of adventure sometimes i think an example hmm well an example of what exactly you mean what aspect okay well example like uh traveling sometimes you wanna go to a particular place and it's uh something great happening there even though it's a great place but it's not such a cool place to go like take for instance like boston i used to go there a lot um now you know everybody i talk to is like a little bit nervous whether they should go there <laughter> you know to do you know uh um xxx you know have a great time you know i think it's because of all the disturbance that just happened kinda you know throws you off track a bit make you rethink um is that a good getaway spot still right now something like that you know mhm mm uh me i huh i take walks i call up a friend we have tea or something you know uh i think i pretty much gotten that under control mm eh uh it was probably something silly in a work situation that last about five minutes and oh pretty much haven't fought again i don't really dwell on negative things too much uh um i don't have any regrets right now mm i really can't think of anything right off the top the hardest decision i've ever had to make was uh not hiring a good friend uh for a job that you know they weren't qualified for that's hard uh because you have to explain to them that it's not the friendship you're hiring it's their competence my father uh he just uh taught me how to you know uh overcome uh difficulties when i was growing up and how important it was to not give up uh and be able to see the bright side of any situation you face because it goes away you know if you hold in there long enough and i i found that to be true so mhm um it's okay except <exce> except for some of my uh my distant siblings you know i don't see as often as i can mm yeah uh just you know when you when you travel quite a bit you just don't see people 'cause <laughter> they're not always there you know uh it's nothing like mhm yeah mhm uh well you know i'm i'm i get pretty excited if i'm working on something or developing something so i tend to overlook the time sometime but other than that you know when i when i'm out i'm out that's it well uh i guess i'll be a little bit uh uh try and figure out how i'm gonna get sleep you know as soon as i can to make up xxx but um uh i i try not to be uh grumpy or anything i just probably feel a little bit tired mm i feel okay now uh changes like what mm well i i i see a more hopeful future you know and i see uh i see a lot of new things unfolding i mean from that perspective yes no never uh i feel okay now uh i went to a great party last week that was really cool yeah well it was like on a rooftop uh and a a lot to really uh nice people who are basically in the same kind of uh mindset uh pursuing the same type of uh uh goals and it was uh quite inspiring actually and i got a lot of information and a lot of good connections were made mm awesome guy awesome absolutely awesome my ideal weekend is uh cooking my own food relaxing you know and if i'm in the mood for company you know i have friends and uh you know uh family members join me well i'd kinda like to put on more weight sometime but that doesn't seem to work i eat like crazy and nothing happen mm well you know i i think people in general sometime uh uh misread <mis> misread you you know if you kinda like uh if you look different or you're in <i> in a different type of a if a different set of things make you uh excited or you're into a different way of thinking um people tend to misjudge you you know and that used to make make me really be upset sometime but um yeah i'm i've kinda figured it out and i'm pretty much over that you know so i see it as their loss and not mine you know if they didn't get to know me you know that's hey maybe they don't need to and it doesn't really bother me i've kinda worked those things out in time you know yeah uh my best qualities probably um uh listening i think <mumbling> and uh maybe just uh talking uh you know on a conversational level uh yeah sometime people tend to burden me with everything they got because of that but uh you know i guess is that's probably one of the things that come with the turf so when i <clears throat> when i see too much of that i just uh pull back uh uh go for your dream believe in what you're doing don't let anyone discourage you and you'll be okay and that's the way i feel now that it's uh kind of evolved itself most proud of um i think my um my my my kinda spiritual relationship you know and my my my settleness about not being too too anxious about about <bout> things that go on around me and being able to see that you know there are no mistakes that really happen and you shouldn't really uh never allow yourself to be defeated i'm i'm proud to be able to have arrived at that point in my my my thinking my framework uh that i think that saved me a lot of uh problems that could've been uh differently <mumbles> very good questions uh i bye bye
