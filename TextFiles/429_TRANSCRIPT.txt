<synch> i'm good yes i'm good iowa when or why uh two thousand one mm holidays and special family events uh it's much better there scrubbed_entry and i uh got into u_c_l_a went to u_c_l_a for three years in their screenwriting program mhm <sniffle> it's took a long time it was difficult mm just the uh the stress <st> getting used to and managing the stress of everyday living you know mm variety there's a lot of variety <vari> there's a lot of variety here i like that <scoff> the obvious traffic <laughter> uh internationally no uh <sigh> just haven't had reason to i guess i have a b_s in math and physics um <sigh> i went to school later in life and i wanted to actually know something so um it was very difficult  very difficult but i did it mm why um it fascinated me i didn't wanna be intimidated by it oh yeah oh yeah <laughter> um to be employed writer extremely difficult extremely difficult writing any type of fictional fiction writing's extremely difficult if i worked then <th> as hard as i do now when i was in school i'd have a p_h_d in math and physics <sigh> it's so hard outgoing it depends on the circumstance it's it's not a catch-all depends on the the moment what do i do to relax i swim mhm swam when last time i swam um last friday yeah mm last friday what do i do when i am annoyed mm swear to myself pretty good mm pretty good takes takes a lot to get me to express anger but i do it was in traffic actually <laughter> so probably two weeks ago so in traffic sure um scrubbed_entry um just waiting for the light <l> light and some guy in a pickup is honking at me i'm like so i honk back and so he didn't like that and he pulled up along side me i had have no idea what his problem was and um we had a little <li> few words yeah i mean i i have no idea what i was doing wrong just waiting for the light guilty that's a strong word <sigh> don't know if i feel guilty as i feel remorseful about actions or words said and done in the past they come up oh just past interpersonal <inter> you know interpersonal reactions with friends or family you know it'll just hit you one day you're not necessarily thinking about it for whatever reason and just out of the blue it hits you and i'm like oh why'd i say that why'd i do that <deep breath> mm <sigh> a situation xxx <sigh> uh woo drawing a blank um for me that question has a negative connotation so something that's possibly negative in my recent past um <sigh> what would i have done differently i've i don't i'm pretty in control of my emotions and taking the temperature of the moment and responding knowing when to respond and when and knowing not to respond um so nothing really springs  to mind that i wish i had done differently recently in my past past yes but not recently oh swallowing my pride putting my tail between my legs and saying i was wrong to friends sure scrubbed_entry um scrubbed_entry i contacted him again and then we're fast friends again mhm <sigh> <sigh> you know this is again this is past past so not recent past so um probably altercations that i've had with my uh mom you know things i've said to hurt her you know you know when you hurt the ones that are closest to you that sticks so any time any one of those situations you know so when i'm i think my emotional i_q has grown so i think in the past past my emotional i_q was very was stuck on infant <laughter> so so i have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters and their families um my father never had a good relationship don't know if that will be possible he's still alive but he's in advanced alzheimer's so he's mad at everybody right now oh it's fine you know it was slow so someone oh um scrubbed_entry has been positive influence in my life um my sisters i talk with my sisters so extremely easy i sleep well each night about <abo> anywhere from at least eight to ten hours a night <laughter> yeah oh lethargic um <sigh> just going through the motions <laughter> you know um it's like this i'll frame it like this david lynch who is not necessarily mainstream he's done some crazy stuff as far as movies and t_v's concerned he said the idea of the angst-driven artist is b_s he says you wanna be creative get a good night's sleep i like that mhm good um i can't wait to get up and start the day oh um if if that happens it's gradual i'm always thinking about my behavior and my thought processes and how to be more productive in my life with what p eh you mean no i don't think so no i haven't be diagnosed <diag> no i haven't been xxx diagnosed with any psychological acronym <laughter> no <deep breath> uh <sigh> this weekend had a good good time with friends we had a great mm was with friends and we just were able to talk about you know some things and uh for <fo> conversation lasted for two and a half hour three hours didn't expect it to happen it was good i like talking with smart people informed people open-minded people it was a great those types of discussions are rare it's almost like running <ru> uh the high you get after running or exercising you know the endorphins it was the same thing i um <sigh> either with friends or working on my stuff my writing or exercising my heighth <laughter> i wish i were taller um i wish mm taller uh physical <phys> just physicality um i wish i didn't wear glasses mhm nothing internal mm i'm patient i've been commended for my patience by strangers um mm my relationships with my friends and my family i understand that it takes time and energy to maintain them and i take that time and energy well that's a really open general question of course you know it goes back um are you talking recently are you talking in the past <pa> um i always regret <sigh> things <th> i regret this is a little thing it's not a big thing not being more productive or efficient in the use of my time each day it's a little thing <laughter> you know so i hate wasting time i hate wasting money i hate wasting energy <deep breath> <sigh> hm that's a deep question <sigh> i'd say i was codependant ten or twenty years ago i'd say get some help get some help you're co you're co mm k sure bye
