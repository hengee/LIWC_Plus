<synch> yeah sure i'm fine thank you i am from los angeles well you can't beat the weather um and i just think the familiarity of home just uh makes me feel comfortable here smog uh rudeness although it doesn't compare to new york it's um <laughter> people can be unbearable when they're rude um not as much as i'd like lately i traveled more in the past but uh not lately no i just think seeing different places it's um learning new things uh finding things that are fascinating that peak my interest um let's see i think <laughter> spoke of new york earlier i think the first time i went to new york i was quite amazed i know it's uh still <st> still only in america but i just think um being from l_a i didn't think anything or any city could be bigger and more uh how do you say uh ostentatious than new york but uh it was it was quite an experience and uh i didn't think any place was uh i didn't <di> i didn't think any place was dirtier than downtown l_a <laughter> but i think times <time> i think <laughter> times square's got us beat too many to mention i i don't even know where to start suppose it depends on the situation um i like to walk i like to uh i like to play with my dogs uh reading uh anything where i guess i suppose i could just sit still let and let my mind go blank i know reading requires some concentration but uh you know just uh things that uh i don't have to um exert myself too much uh helps me relax <sigh> in the past i've had problems but i'm getting better <laughter> let's just say that <laughter> ah probably argued with my roommate <psh> couple days ago but uh that happens we're friends uh it's a loving argument <laughter> if if you will uh i met this roommate about six seven years ago we just uh kind of um kinda moved around the same social circles and just got along it's cool i mean guess you know like we do argue uh we have our differences sometimes but there's not one person i'd rather have i'd rather live with than than her she's she's cool hmm how much time do we have uh <laughter> it's just too numerous to mention um i i i wouldn't know how to answer that i think breaking up with a girlfriend that i truly cared about but knowing knowing that it just wasn't going to work um that was very difficult just weighed pros and cons and just thought it just wasn't going to work um no matter how much love or care i brought to the relationship there was something missing and i think i invested enough time she invested enough time and just knew it was over no so many <laughter> i don't have too many regrets but things you erase from your memory oh there's a lot uh too numerous to mention i don't know how to answer that the same girl that i broke up with she was the she was a girlfriend <laughter> of uh a a best friend of mine uh they were separated for for several years and we always had a chemistry always a friendship and it turned into something to something which you know turned into a relationship and uh it hurt him uh and currently we do not speak i wish uh my regret is i wish i i would've handled that better <scoff> um it's it's funny see as i as i get older i'm not as close but i still care for 'em and i still love them and i think they love me i my mother and my father are both alive mm don't interact a whole lot i'm very close to my older sister my older sister um she's just strong no nonsense uh she's short yet a firecracker and i've always liked that about her she uh uh she always felt makes me feel makes me feel comfortable i'm like uh another son to her <laughter> in a way uh suppose it depends on my stress level um when i have a lot on my mind i have difficult sleeping and uh other times it just if i really need to get to sleep it just requires me listen to the radio listen <lis> uh watching t_v reading and eventually i'll get tired fall asleep crabby uh i suppose like anybody else um tired listless you know all the normal things i suppose happen when somebody doesn't sleep well i feel good mm no not really um no no i i wouldn't say i have no i have not yes i have i was diagnosed probably about about five years ago i think uh i always knew there was a problem i always knew there was some i i i think i always knew before i got treatment that there was some issue emotionally and hmm and lot of things that are very hard to explain and i just was tired of feeling that way so i sought help think just uh lethargy uh uh no desire to do anything uh motivation just was wasn't there um think normal depression type things uh um social <socia> i became socially awkward which was a little bit different for me 'cause uh growing up i was you know quite talkative <laughter> i do i'm sorry say again gotcha um it does i think it does well um <sigh> i think the number one thing and this is what i'm amazed about is the temper i think i've uh it's allowed me to to step back from certain situations and not take them so seriously and not get so tense or angry and then react i think it's it it's calmed me down for the most part now it's becoming it it it's becoming routine uh initially it was very difficult when i was five years old <laughter> oh no when <wh> when you're a kid there's nothing really to um there's nothing to be sad about you're a kid my best friend um a jerk i don't yeah uh i have a dry i have a dry sense of humor so uh you know my best friend would probably uh i think the the banter back and forth is you know usually an insult but you know it's all in love um i wish i could be taller i wish i could be more inclined to play basketball so i then become go to the n_b_a and be a millionaire i know that's all unrealistic but just answering honestly hmm anything i regret haven't we asked asked this before i mean so many don't know where to start mm that's a good one wow um wow i don't know i you know that's a good one i'd have <ha> i'd have to think about that i don't i wouldn't wanna answer that uh that's a good one usually you're asked um what you'd what you know how you feel ten twenty years from now looking back i don't know what advice i'd give myself something i really enjoyed um hmm i love um there are several things i like to do um uh you know i uh i enjoy playing basketball i i i love watching it i love watching all sports for that matter what brings me real joy the past few years was um become a hobby of mine is is uh rescuing dogs fostering dogs and finding them them homes uh it's <laughter> i guess it's become quite a a hobby of mine and uh sometimes i find lost dogs and i'm able to find their owner and sometimes i'm not so when i'll tell you what there's nothing <noth> to find the owner and i just found an owner last week for a small dog i found eh there is not greater feeling 'cause the man told me <laughter> the man told me how his um how his <hi> how his daughter or was just crying when she left so to be able to give her give him back that was that was cool i think for somebody that um didn't finish high school going on to college and graduating that's something that i uh i take pride in though i don't show it or speak about it often <laughter> yeah you look you look like my friend rachel it's funny <laughter>
