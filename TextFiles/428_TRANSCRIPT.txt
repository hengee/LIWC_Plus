<synch> <laughter> yeah i'm good how are you i'm from here <he> um from los angeles <clears throat> probably the downtown the view and it's not that i like it but that's just where i for my parents were so that's where i grew up nothing that's where i live i i love l_a <laughter> maybe that it's ghetto but that's about it <laughter> <clears throat> i was thinking of going for sound engineer or mechanic hmm but i'm not sure <clears throat> 'cause <cau> 'cause my dad um he used to do that mm i'm not even sure to be honest haven't really thought about it i can't look at your shoes uh no i don't travel like that i don't know maybe money <m> money issue or something if i had money yeah i'll go all all over the world just <laughter> probably um outgoing depends i guess i don't know <laughter> about what shy or outgoing <clears throat> well outgoing you could be outgoing at a party you know like you're already out there so you can't be shy i guess if you're going to a party good probably um my girlfriend and 'cause i missed work 'cause i just felt lazy i was like whatever you know i just didn't wanna go and i i do what i want <laughter> i just didn't go nah not really she's over it already as long as we have the bills and rent paid <laughter> don't worry guilty probably nothing i guess i should've gone to work <laughter> mm <clears throat> damn that i could erase from that probably bad friends that i've met you know like friends that trick you you know that said that that they just trick you friends that deceive you i guess okay like um my friend told me that he had a good job at some car wash place so he told me to to he's gonna get me hired there and give me direct deposit but then he ended up actually going into my account and taking money from my account so <laughter> <clears throat> probably moving out and into my mom's house yeah i haven't really been around eh like a big decision like that i wanted my own space you know my own life i wanna do what i want and come home when i want leave when i want yeah <laughter> yeah <laughter> uh we're all close we're all you know we hardly argue we're all always around we always see each other my mom my dad my brother <laughter> how they were a positive in my life well they're always there for you you know whether you have financial problems they're there they help you out whether you're sad they know you know and they'd be like hey what's wrong you know let's go out and eat somewhere just to cheer you up they're xxx they're your family and they're always there to motivate you and keep you going <sigh> uh easy actually yeah pretty easy i'm sorry um i haven't noticed but maybe probably the same you know i don't think sleep does affect you but i don't know maybe more tired but i don't think annoyed or mad or anything like that good everything's great um maybe that i wanna start <s> know like start a new business or something <clears throat> well like my dad um he wasn't around for a while but he just got back and um he actually opened up a shop and he's getting a a a lot of customers so i see that his business is growing so i'm probably gonna learn learn <lear> um learn mechanic like like i was saying earlier at school <clears throat> i don't even know what it what is that no nope <coughs> <coughs> i'm sorry um yesterday <laughter> last night 'cause i got a new game <laughter> <coughs> that i'm funny <laughter> i uh uh no <coughs> um i don't think nothing everything's fine you know thank god everything's good right now i don't think there's nothing to change like that maybe a better job well first of all i don't even have a job so i guess to change i get a job nah it's hard for someone to put me down like that <clears throat> xxx could say probably that i'm responsible as well at home resting and then i call some friends over they usually do come over barbecue whatever comes to mind you know just there in my house 'cause i have a nice backyard 'cause i just moved to this new house so so far each xxx yeah so each weekend right now we just people come over family come over and we pretty pretty much just barbecue there just hang out <clears throat> my sister's birthday party it was on saturday and it was fun there was a lot of dancing you know people uh i saw family that i haven't seen for a while so i enjoyed doing that so <clears throat> probably that i was like i was able to help my mom throughout because she was going through a really hard time my mom and um for almost nine years 'cause she was having hard trouble paying bills and rent so i i'm proud that i was able to help her even though i could only give so little but she at least we're all still good you know and we're still alive and everyone's still blessed and um being around my family music music always puts me in a good mood any kinda music even if it's even if it's depressing music it's still gonna <go> it it's still gonna get me happy yeah <laughter> mhm no problem
